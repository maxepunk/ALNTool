# Phase 2: Feature Implementation Sprint

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 successfully created a solid architectural foundation but failed to deliver working user-facing features. Phase 2 will focus exclusively on implementing complete, working features using vertical slices and continuous integration.

## Key Principles

1. **Feature-First Development**: Each specialist owns complete features, not layers
2. **Definition of Done**: A feature is only "done" when a user can successfully use it
3. **Continuous Integration**: Daily integration checkpoints, no isolated work
4. **User Validation**: Every feature must be testable by running the app
5. **No Architecture Changes**: Use existing foundation, focus on implementation

## Team Structure

### 1. **Graph Visualization Lead** (Days 1-3)
**Mission**: Make the graph actually show all entity types and relationships

**Deliverables**:
- ✓ All 7 edge types visible and distinguishable
- ✓ Progressive entity loading that actually works
- ✓ Visual hierarchy with proper opacity/scale
- ✓ Force-directed layout with ownership clustering
- ✓ Proper node positioning without overlap

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can see character-character relationships
- User can load elements/puzzles/timeline events progressively
- User can distinguish between different edge types visually
- Nodes don't overlap or cluster incorrectly

### 2. **Interaction & Selection Lead** (Days 2-4)
**Mission**: Fix entity selection and implement all interactions

**Deliverables**:
- ✓ Entity selection that preserves correct IDs
- ✓ Hover effects on nodes and edges
- ✓ Click-to-focus mode that works properly
- ✓ Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, escape, etc.)
- ✓ Multi-select with shift/ctrl

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clicking a node shows correct entity details
- Hovering shows preview information
- Focus mode centers on selected entity
- Keyboard navigation works

### 3. **Intelligence Layer Lead** (Days 3-5)
**Mission**: Make intelligence layers display actual data

**Deliverables**:
- ✓ Economic layer shows token values and flows
- ✓ Story layer displays narrative connections
- ✓ Social layer shows collaboration requirements
- ✓ Production layer indicates physical dependencies
- ✓ Content gaps highlights missing elements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Toggling each layer shows relevant information
- Data is accurate and up-to-date
- Visual overlays don't interfere with graph interaction
- Performance remains acceptable with layers active

### 4. **Integration & Polish Lead** (Days 4-6)
**Mission**: Ensure everything works together seamlessly

**Deliverables**:
- ✓ All features work together without conflicts
- ✓ Performance optimization (viewport culling, virtualization)
- ✓ Error handling for all edge cases
- ✓ Loading states and transitions
- ✓ Consistent visual design

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- App handles 400+ entities without freezing
- No console errors during normal use
- Smooth transitions between states
- Consistent UI/UX across all features

## Implementation Strategy

### Day 0: Setup & Coordination
- All specialists review current codebase state
- Identify specific broken features from Phase 1
- Set up shared testing environment
- Create integration test checklist

### Days 1-2: Foundation Features
- Graph Visualization Lead: Implement all edge types
- Interaction Lead: Fix entity selection bug
- Daily sync: Ensure selection works with new edges

### Days 3-4: Core Features
- Graph Visualization: Progressive loading & layout
- Interaction: Hover states & focus mode
- Intelligence Layer: Begin layer implementation
- Daily sync: Test all interactions together

### Days 5-6: Polish & Integration
- Intelligence Layer: Complete all 5 layers
- Integration Lead: Performance optimization
- All: Bug fixes and polish
- Final integration testing

## Success Metrics

1. **User Can**: See all relationship types in the graph
2. **User Can**: Click any entity and see correct details
3. **User Can**: Load different entity types progressively
4. **User Can**: Toggle intelligence layers and see data
5. **User Can**: Use keyboard shortcuts for navigation
6. **Performance**: <100ms response time for interactions
7. **Stability**: Zero console errors in normal use

## Daily Checkpoints

Each day ends with:
1. Working feature demonstration
2. Integration test with other features
3. Update to progress tracking
4. Identification of blockers

## Testing Protocol

Every feature must pass:
1. **Unit tests**: Component works in isolation
2. **Integration tests**: Works with other features
3. **User flow tests**: Complete user journey works
4. **Performance tests**: Maintains 60fps

## Communication Rules

1. **No isolated work**: All code pushed daily
2. **Feature flags**: New features behind flags until complete
3. **Pair reviews**: Each feature reviewed by another specialist
4. **User demos**: Record short videos of working features

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined features only
2. **Integration Issues**: Daily integration checkpoints
3. **Performance**: Test with full dataset regularly
4. **Incomplete Features**: Feature flags for graceful degradation

## Definition of "Complete"

A feature is complete when:
1. It works as described
2. It integrates with other features
3. It has no console errors
4. It performs acceptably
5. A user can use it without guidance

## Post-Implementation

- User testing session
- Performance profiling
- Bug fix prioritization
- Documentation of working features
- Handoff to maintenance mode

*This plan prioritizes working features over perfect code. The goal is a functional application that users can actually use.*
