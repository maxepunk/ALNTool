- **Phase 3: Optimization** ðŸ“… TODO

### Current Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 1 - Stabilization  
**Started**: January 2025  
**Progress**: 0/8 hours

## Deprecated Phase Systems

The following phase systems are NO LONGER VALID and should be ignored:

1. **Original Development Phases** (Sprint 1-5)
   - Used: June-July 2024
   - Deprecated: Replaced by technical debt approach
   
2. **P.DEBT.X.X System**
   - Used: August-November 2024
   - Deprecated: Completed and archived
   
3. **"Phase 0.5 - Critical Stabilization"**
   - Used: Brief period in November 2024
   - Deprecated: Merged into Architecture Remediation

4. **"Final Mile" References**
   - Used: Documentation drift period
   - Deprecated: Not a real phase, just aspirational language

## Why This Document Exists

Multiple phase systems caused confusion. This document is the ONLY source of truth for:
- What phase we're in
- What work is being done
- What's completed vs planned

All other phase references in documentation should be considered outdated.

## Update Protocol

This document should be updated:
- When starting a new task
- When completing a task
- When transitioning phases
