# ALNTool Vision: Design Intelligence for About Last Night

> **Last Updated**: 2025-01-07  
> **Status**: Synthesized from core UX understanding documents  
> **Purpose**: Unified vision for ALNTool development

## What We're Building

ALNTool is **design decision support intelligence** for "About Last Night" - a murder mystery game where 20-40 simultaneous players navigate social puzzles, discover hidden memories, and face moral choices under time pressure.

The tool transforms 18 separate database views into a unified interface where game designers can select any entity (character, element, puzzle, timeline event) and instantly see complete impact analysis across all game dimensions.

## The Game We're Designing For

### Two Acts + Transformation

**Act 1: Social Investigation (60-90 minutes)**
- Players start with locked compartments and individual puzzles
- Each puzzle requires elements that OTHER players possess
- Forced collaboration reveals story through social choreography
- Players think: "I'm solving a murder mystery with others"

**The Revelation Scene (Game Transforms)**
- First memory token discovered â†’ Detective scans publicly
- Video reveals room full of more tokens
- Black Market dealer offers cash
- Detective offers story completion
- Limited scanners force sharing
- THE MEMORY ECONOMY BEGINS

**Act 2: Choice Under Pressure (30-45 minutes)**
- Rush to collect memory tokens
- Three-way prisoner's dilemma emerges
- Paths represent choices, not content routes
- All players access same story differently

### The Three Paths (Choice Space)

1. **Black Market Path** - Turn in tokens for cash with multipliers
2. **Detective Path** - Complete the story through collective effort  
3. **Return to Owner** - Character development through roleplay
4. **Keep Token** - Corruption, no benefit

## The Design Challenge

Designers must simultaneously balance four dimensions:

### 1. Story Dimension
- Timeline events (backstory and party night)
- Character secrets and relationships
- Narrative discovery flow
- Story coherence across all paths

### 2. Social Dimension
- Who must collaborate when and why
- Social load balancing across characters
- Personality matching for casting
- Meaningful dramatic moments

### 3. Economic Dimension
- Token values creating choice pressure
- Path balance (all equally attractive)
- Set bonus strategies
- Risk/reward tension

### 4. Production Dimension
- Physical props and RFID tokens
- Dependency chains and failure points
- Scalability for simultaneous play
- Logistics of prop movement

**No human can track this four-dimensional complexity across 20-40 characters.**

## User Archetypes & Their Needs

### ðŸŽ­ Sarah - Experience Designer
**Challenge**: Design character journeys creating meaningful interactions

**Questions**:
- "If Victoria's affair token is worth $5000, how does that affect choices?"
- "Which characters should discover Victoria's story for maximum impact?"
- "What timeline events best reveal her backstory?"

**Needs**: See ripple effects of any story decision across all dimensions

### ðŸ§© Marcus - Puzzle Designer  
**Challenge**: Create puzzles that choreograph social interactions

**Questions**:
- "If I change required elements, which interactions change?"
- "Should this reward be high-value (pressure) or low (easy story)?"
- "Does this create meaningful or awkward collaboration?"

**Needs**: Understand social choreography created by puzzle mechanics

### ðŸ“¦ Alex - Production Coordinator
**Challenge**: Track physical reality of complex interactions

**Questions**:
- "What props enable this character's interactions?"
- "If Derek's player doesn't show, which puzzles break?"
- "Which missing elements break the most journeys?"

**Needs**: Complete dependency tracking and failure analysis

### ðŸŽ¨ Jamie - Content Creator
**Challenge**: Develop rich content for underwritten characters

**Questions**:
- "How do I integrate Howie's backstory into existing systems?"
- "What token values support story without breaking economy?"
- "Which characters have capacity for new content?"

**Needs**: Find integration opportunities without overwhelming balance

## The Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Design Decision Support (Current)
- Read-only intelligence showing impact of any change
- Entity selection reveals four-dimensional analysis
- "If I change this, what breaks?"

### Phase 2: Real-Time Creation Preview
- Create content with live impact visualization
- Test changes before committing
- "Let me try this and see what happens"

### Phase 3: Integrated Design Environment
- Replace Notion UI for game design
- Direct manipulation with intelligence embedded
- "I design everything here"

### Phase 4: Collaborative Design Platform
- Multiple designers working simultaneously
- Real-time impact sharing
- "We design together with shared intelligence"

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Entity-Centric Intelligence
Every interaction starts with selecting an entity. The analysis IS the interface.

### 2. Impact Over Information
Don't show data - show consequences. "What breaks if I change this?"

### 3. Progressive Complexity
Simple selection â†’ Deep intelligence. Easy to start, powerful to master.

### 4. Design Confidence
Every decision backed by complete impact analysis across all dimensions.

### 5. Integration Focus
Highlight opportunities, not just problems. "Where can this fit?"

## Intelligence Layers

When any entity is selected, five intelligence layers provide:

### 1. Economic Intelligence
- Token values and multipliers
- Path balance analysis
- Choice pressure metrics
- Set bonus impacts

### 2. Story Intelligence  
- Timeline connections
- Narrative flow
- Discovery patterns
- Content gaps

### 3. Social Intelligence
- Required collaborations
- Interaction choreography
- Social load distribution
- Personality requirements

### 4. Production Intelligence
- Prop dependencies
- RFID implementation
- Missing elements
- Logistics requirements

### 5. Content Gap Intelligence
- Integration opportunities
- Underutilized characters
- Missing connections
- Balance improvements

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- Complete page consolidation (18 â†’ 1)
- 2-second entity â†’ full analysis
- Design confidence: "I understand impact"
- Zero context switching

### Ultimate Success
- Designers never open Notion UI
- All design decisions intelligence-backed
- 5x faster game development
- Perfect four-dimensional balance

## The Value Proposition

**From**: 18 spreadsheets + mental math + "hope it works in playtest"

**To**: Unified intelligence showing complete impact of any design decision

ALNTool isn't just a tool - it's the foundation for designing a new category of games: **socially choreographed narrative experiences** where player interactions create story discovery through carefully balanced game mechanics.
