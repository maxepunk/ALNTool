# Game Design Concept Evolution (Streamlined)

This document tracks how "About Last Night" evolved from initial concepts to validated design.

## Core Design Evolution

### 1. Game Structure
- **Initial**: Basic two-act division
- **Evolution**: Distinct gameplay modes with different mechanics
- **Final**: Act 1 investigation (45-60min) → Act 2 memory economy (45-60min)
- **Impact**: Natural narrative escalation through mechanical shift

### 2. Memory Economy
- **Initial**: "Sketch-level" trading system
- **Evolution**: Three parallel resolution paths with different values
- **Final**: Black Market (wealth), Detective (truth), Third Path (community)
- **Impact**: Multiple play styles accommodate different player values

### 3. Character Scalability
- **Initial**: Focus on 5 core characters
- **Evolution**: Three-tier system for 5-20 players
- **Final**: Core 5 + Secondary (6+) + Tertiary (13+)
- **Impact**: All players get complete experiences regardless of group size

### 4. Information Architecture
- **Initial**: Simple clue → solution model
- **Evolution**: Complex discovery networks
- **Final**: 4 databases (designer tools) → player discoveries
- **Impact**: Organic investigation through designed relationships

### 5. Memory Token Distribution
- **Initial**: Core characters get most tokens
- **Evolution**: Recognition of Act 1/Act 2 balance needs
- **Final**: Lower tiers get MORE tokens to compensate
- **Impact**: Every character tier has spotlight moments

## Key Design Patterns

### Emergence Over Prescription
- Third Path discovered through play, not signposted
- Edge cases handled through human judgment
- Victory conditions intentionally flexible

### Physical-Digital Integration
- RFID tokens make abstract memories tangible
- 3 scanners create scarcity and negotiation
- Physical turn-in prevents digital manipulation

### Thematic Reinforcement
- Every mechanic reflects surveillance capitalism
- Memory commodification mirrors data exploitation
- Third Path embodies resistance to systematization

## Creator Interview Validations

### Confirmed Design Choices
- Timeline hidden from players (archaeological discovery)
- 3-5 starting items only (maximize discovery impact)
- Databases as design tools (clean separation)
- Lower tiers get more tokens (balance philosophy)
- 50-55 total tokens planned
- Edge case flexibility intentional

### Corrected Understanding
- 3 scanners, not 5-6 (creates meaningful scarcity)
- Only Ephemeral Echo defined (other groups need development)
- Detective trapped in glass room (narrative justification)
- Victory thresholds relative, not absolute

### New Revelations
- Two-facilitator system (Detective + Black Market)
- Physical token turn-in required
- No electronic Third Path tracking
- Some Act 1 evidence may convert to tokens
- Training priorities: lobby + Black Market operation

## Current Status

### Complete
- Game design (100% validated)
- 13 tokens documented (26% of 50-55)
- Ephemeral Echo defined (6 components)
- Physical space layout confirmed

### Needed
- 37-42 additional tokens
- Memory group definitions beyond Ephemeral Echo
- Accessibility implementations
- Black Market facilitation training

## Design Philosophy

"Success lies somewhere between the player experience and the artistic statement... serious food for thought around the themes of the game that the players do not feel beaten over the head with but instead hopefully feel like they arrived at on their own."

The game intentionally preserves space for human creativity within its systems, resisting complete documentation as a design feature that embodies its themes.
