# Documentation Consolidation Archive - January 2025

This archive contains documentation files moved during the January 2025 documentation consolidation effort.

## Why This Archive Was Created

### The Problem
- 200+ markdown files across the project
- Multiple deprecated phase numbering systems causing confusion
- Documentation drift and contradictory information
- Solo developer unable to maintain extensive documentation
- AI assistance slowed by searching through massive documentation

### The Solution
Consolidated to 11 essential documents referenced by CLAUDE.md:
1. CLAUDE.md (master guide)
2. README.md
3. DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md
4. SCHEMA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md
5. AUTHORITY_MATRIX.md
6. docs/PHASE_TRACKER.md
7. MCP_GUIDE.md
8. WSL2_DEV_BEST_PRACTICES.md
9. ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md
10. QUICK_START.md
11. ARCHITECTURE_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md

## What's In This Archive

### Root Level Files
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Historical architecture documentation
- HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md - Template for session handoffs
- WSL_RECOVERY_PLAN.md - WSL-specific recovery documentation
- Various other .md files not actively referenced

### /docs Directory Files
- CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md
- DEVELOPER_QUICK_START.md
- DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md
- TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md

### /storyforge Directory Files

- Backend and frontend specific documentation
- Component-level documentation

### /SampleNotionData Directory
- All sample data markdown files (character sheets, elements, puzzles, timelines)

## Archive Policy

Files were archived because they:
- Were not referenced by CLAUDE.md
- Contained deprecated information
- Were component-specific READMEs better kept with code
- Were sample data files not needed for development

## Accessing Archived Content

These files remain available for historical reference but should NOT be used for current development decisions. For current information, always refer to the 11 core documents listed above.
