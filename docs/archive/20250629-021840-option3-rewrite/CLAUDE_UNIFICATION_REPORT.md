# Claude Instance Unification Diagnostic Report
Date: June 11, 2025

## Executive Summary
- **Current Issue**: Two separate Claude instances (Desktop vs CLI) with separate configurations
- **User Context**: Both instances are actively used for different purposes
- **Impact**: MCP servers only configured in Desktop, configs not shared, different behaviors
- **Goal**: Better integration between instances while preserving both
- **Root Cause**: [To be determined through investigation]

## Important Context
The user actively uses both:
- **Claude Desktop**: For general use and Windows-based tasks
- **Claude CLI (via Cursor)**: For development work in WSL environment
Both serve different purposes and should be preserved.

## Current State Analysis

### Windows Claude Desktop
- **Installation Path**: `C:\Users\spide\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\`
- **Version**: [Checking...]
- **Executable**: [Checking exact .exe location]
- **Config Location**: `C:\Users\spide\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **How it's launched**: Desktop shortcut, Start menu
- **MCP Server Support**: ✅ Yes (fully configured)
- **Profile/Settings**: Established (has theme, preferences)

### WSL Claude CLI  
- **Installation Type**: Claude Code CLI (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Installation Paths**: 
  - Primary: `/home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/`
  - Local wrapper: `/home/spide/.claude/local/` (just a wrapper to npm package)
- **Version**: 1.0.17 (from package.json)
- **Executable**: Symlink chain: `claude` → nvm bin → `@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js`
- **Config Location**: `/home/spide/.claude/settings.json`
- **How it's launched**: `claude` command in terminal
- **MCP Server Support**: ✅ YES! (via `--mcp-config` flag or `mcp` subcommand)
- **Profile/Settings**: Separate from Desktop (asks for theme on startup)

**Key Finding**: This is Claude Code CLI, not the same application as Claude Desktop
**Critical Discovery**: Claude Code CLI DOES support MCP servers!

### Cursor Integration
- **How Cursor launches Claude**: Via Claude button in IDE
- **Which instance it uses**: WSL CLI (`/home/spide/.claude/local/`)
- **Current behavior**: Opens fresh Claude instance, no MCP servers
- **Can this be configured?**: [To investigate]

## Technical Investigation

### File System Analysis

#### WSL Claude Installation Contents
- [ ] Check what's in `/home/spide/.claude/local/`
- [ ] Is it a full installation or wrapper?
- [ ] Check for config files in `~/.config/claude/` or similar
- [ ] Look for any symlinks or scripts

#### Config File Compatibility
- [ ] Compare config formats between Desktop and CLI
- [ ] Can they share the same config structure?
- [ ] Path format differences (Windows vs Unix)

#### Execution Mechanisms
- [ ] How is `claude` command defined in WSL?
- [ ] Can WSL execute Windows GUI applications?
- [ ] What happens with `wslg` (WSL GUI support)?

### Integration Points

#### /ide Command Investigation
- [ ] How does `/ide` command work in Claude Desktop?
- [ ] What protocol does it use to communicate with IDEs?
- [ ] Can this be redirected or proxied?

#### Cursor's Claude Button
- [ ] Where is this configured in Cursor?
- [ ] Can we modify which executable it calls?
- [ ] Does it use an extension or built-in integration?

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] What env vars does each Claude instance use?
- [ ] Are there any that control instance selection?
- [ ] Can we use env vars to redirect execution?

## Unification Options

### Option 1: Symlink/Alias Approach
**Concept**: Make WSL `claude` command point to Windows Claude Desktop
- **Pros**: Simple, maintains single installation
- **Cons**: GUI execution from WSL might have issues
- **Requirements**: WSLg support, proper argument passing

### Option 2: Wrapper Script Approach  
**Concept**: Replace WSL claude with script that calls Windows Claude
- **Pros**: Full control over execution, can handle edge cases
- **Cons**: Requires maintenance, might break with updates
- **Requirements**: Script development, testing various scenarios

### Option 3: Single Installation Approach
**Concept**: Remove WSL CLI, only use Windows Desktop
- **Pros**: Simplest, no sync needed
- **Cons**: Might break Cursor integration
- **Requirements**: Cursor reconfiguration

### Option 4: Configuration Sync Approach
**Concept**: Keep both but sync all settings/configs
- **Pros**: Both instances work, consistent experience
- **Cons**: Complex, requires ongoing sync
- **Requirements**: File watchers, path translation

### Option 5: Cursor-Specific Fix
**Concept**: Just fix Cursor to use Windows Claude
- **Pros**: Targeted solution, minimal changes
- **Cons**: Doesn't address general WSL usage
- **Requirements**: Cursor configuration access

## Test Results

### Test 1: WSL Claude Installation Inspection
- [ ] List contents of `/home/spide/.claude/`
- [ ] Check if `claude` is a binary or script
- [ ] Find config file locations

### Test 2: Windows GUI from WSL
- [ ] Test if WSL can launch Windows .exe files
- [ ] Check if GUI apps work properly
- [ ] Test argument passing

### Test 3: Config Format Comparison
- [ ] Compare Desktop vs CLI config structures
- [ ] Test if Desktop can read CLI config
- [ ] Test if CLI can read Desktop config

### Test 4: Cursor Integration
- [ ] Find Cursor's Claude integration settings
- [ ] Test modifying the launch command
- [ ] Check for extension settings

## Findings

### Finding 1: Different Applications, Not Just Different Instances
- **Description**: WSL has Claude Code CLI, while Windows has Claude Desktop - these are fundamentally different applications
- **Evidence**: 
  - WSL: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` npm package (CLI tool)
  - Windows: Full Claude Desktop application
  - Different codebases, different capabilities
- **Impact**: 
  - Cannot simply "unify" them - they're different products
  - MCP servers might not even be supported in Claude Code CLI
  - Need different integration strategy

### Finding 2: Installation Structure in WSL
- **Description**: Claude Code CLI is installed as a global npm package via nvm
- **Evidence**: 
  - Main installation: `/home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/`
  - Command symlink: `/home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/claude`
  - Local wrapper: `/home/spide/.claude/local/` (appears to be legacy/wrapper)
- **Impact**: 
  - Updates through npm, not through Claude Desktop updater
  - Configuration stored separately in `~/.claude/`

### Finding 3: Claude Code CLI Has Built-in Desktop Integration!
- **Description**: Claude Code CLI has a command to import MCP servers from Claude Desktop
- **Evidence**: 
  - `claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop` command exists
  - Specifically mentions "Mac and WSL only" support
  - Can manage MCP servers independently
- **Impact**: 
  - Can sync MCP configurations from Desktop to CLI
  - Solves the MCP server availability issue
  - Provides official integration path

### Finding 4: MCP Configuration Uses Scope-Based Storage
- **Description**: MCP configurations DO persist but use Claude's hierarchical scope system
- **Evidence**: 
  - Project-scoped servers (default) only visible in project root directory
  - User-scoped servers visible across all projects
  - `claude mcp add` defaults to `--scope local` (project-specific)
  - Configuration storage location remains hidden/internal
- **Impact**: 
  - MCP feature IS functional, just misunderstood
  - Need to use `--scope user` for global MCP availability
  - Aligns with Claude's memory hierarchy system

### Finding 5: Expected Configuration Locations Not Used
- **Description**: Documentation references configuration files that don't exist
- **Evidence**: 
  - External docs mention `~/.claude/.claude.json` for Linux/WSL
  - Also mention project-level `.mcp.json` files
  - Neither location has any files after running MCP commands
  - Claude CLI only has minimal `settings.json` with model preference
- **Impact**: 
  - Either documentation is outdated or implementation is incomplete
  - Need to investigate actual implementation behavior

## Critical Assumptions & Unknowns

### Updated Understanding
1. **MCP Implementation**: ✅ WORKS - Uses scope-based storage (project/user/global)
2. **Multiple Installations**: ✅ CONFIRMED - 3 separate Claude Code installations found
3. **Keybinding Conflicts**: ✅ CONFIRMED - Multiple instances compete for same shortcuts
4. **Configuration Storage**: ✅ PARTIALLY SOLVED - Scope-based, but exact location still unknown

### Remaining Unknowns
1. Which Claude instance does Cursor's button actually launch?
2. How to configure Cursor to use the correct Claude instance?
3. Why does Cursor's Claude Code extension exist separately?
4. Can we unify to a single installation without breaking Cursor?
5. Where exactly are MCP configs stored on disk?
6. How to resolve keybinding conflicts between instances?

### New Hypotheses
1. **Version Mismatch**: Global (v1.0.21) vs Local/Cursor (v1.0.17) may cause issues
2. **Extension Architecture**: Cursor may require its own embedded Claude for IDE integration
3. **Port Conflicts**: Multiple MCP servers on different ports may interfere
4. **Path Resolution**: Different instances may use different PATH lookups

## Recommendations

**Updated based on multiple installation discovery:**

### Primary Recommendation: Resolve Multiple Installation Conflicts
The root cause is having 3 separate Claude Code installations competing for resources.

### Option A: Unify to Single Installation (Recommended)
1. Remove local installation at `/home/spide/.claude/local/`
2. Update global installation to latest version
3. Configure Cursor to use global installation
4. Add all MCP servers with `--scope user` for universal access

### Option B: Isolate Cursor's Claude Instance
1. Accept that Cursor needs its own Claude extension
2. Configure MCP servers in Cursor's instance separately
3. Use different keybindings to avoid conflicts
4. Document which instance to use when

### Option C: Fix Keybinding Conflicts
1. Find and modify conflicting keybindings
2. Assign different shortcuts to each instance
3. Keep all installations but prevent conflicts
4. Create wrapper scripts for clarity

### Option D: Investigate Cursor's Launch Mechanism
1. Trace how Cursor's Claude button works
2. Redirect it to use existing session
3. Prevent new instance creation
4. Maintain session continuity

## Implementation Plan

**Next Steps based on discoveries:**

### Phase 1: Clean Up Multiple Installations
1. Document current state of all 3 installations
2. Remove `/home/spide/.claude/local/` installation
3. Test if removal breaks anything
4. Update global installation to v1.0.21 (or latest)

### Phase 2: Configure MCP Servers Properly
1. Add all MCP servers with `--scope user` for global access
2. Verify they work from any directory
3. Test in both terminal and Cursor contexts
4. Document the configuration process

### Phase 3: Resolve Cursor Integration
1. Investigate how Cursor's Claude button launches Claude
2. Try configuring Cursor to use global Claude installation
3. Test if Cursor's embedded extension can be disabled/redirected
4. Resolve keybinding conflicts

### Phase 4: Create Unified Workflow
1. Document the final architecture
2. Create scripts/aliases for consistent usage
3. Test complete workflow: terminal → /ide → Cursor → back
4. Update team documentation

## Investigation Log

### [June 12, 2025 01:30 AM] Import Attempt Results
- **Discovery**: `claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop` command does detect MCP servers (found all 5)
- **Issue**: Command fails due to terminal raw mode incompatibility with non-TTY environment
- **Alternative**: Can add servers manually using `claude mcp add` command
- **Current State**: No MCP servers configured in Claude Code CLI (`claude mcp list` returns empty)

### [June 12, 2025 01:35 AM] Manual Addition Strategy
Since the automatic import fails in our environment, will add servers manually using the command line interface. This achieves the same result without requiring interactive terminal support.

### [June 12, 2025 01:40 AM] Manual MCP Addition Attempts
- Successfully ran `claude mcp add` for all 5 servers (github, filesystem, notionApi, desktop-commander, playwright)
- Each command returned success message: "Added stdio MCP server [name]... to local config"
- However, `claude mcp list` immediately shows "No MCP servers configured"

### [June 12, 2025 01:50 AM] Configuration Persistence Investigation
- **Critical Discovery**: MCP configurations do NOT persist
- Searched for configuration files in multiple locations:
  - No `.mcp.json` in project directory
  - No `~/.claude/.claude.json` file exists
  - No `~/.config/claude/` directory
  - Only minimal `/home/spide/.claude/settings.json` with model preference
- **Conclusion**: MCP add commands give false success messages but don't actually save configurations

### [June 12, 2025 01:55 AM] Documentation vs Reality
- External documentation mentions config file locations that don't exist
- MCP feature appears incomplete or broken in Claude Code CLI v1.0.17
- Need to investigate what `claude mcp add` actually does internally

### [June 12, 2025 02:15 AM] BREAKTHROUGH: MCP Uses Scope-Based Storage!
- **Critical Discovery**: MCP configuration DOES persist, but uses Claude's scope system
- **Evidence**: 
  - `claude mcp list` shows different results in different directories
  - Project-scoped servers only visible in project root
  - User-scoped servers visible everywhere
- **Scope Types**:
  - `--scope local` (default): Project-specific, only visible in that directory
  - `--scope user`: Global for user, visible in all projects
  - `--scope project`: (Not tested yet)
- **Implications**: 
  - Our earlier servers WERE saved, just project-scoped
  - Need to use `--scope user` for global MCP availability
  - This matches Claude's memory hierarchy (CLAUDE.md files)

### [June 12, 2025 02:45 AM] Multiple Claude Code CLI Installations Discovered!
- **Key Finding**: Found multiple Claude Code installations causing conflicts
- **Evidence**:
  1. Global installation: v1.0.21 at `/home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/`
  2. Local installation: v1.0.17 at `/home/spide/.claude/local/`
  3. Cursor extension: v1.0.17 at `/home/spide/.cursor-server/extensions/anthropic.claude-code-1.0.17/`
- **Critical Clue**: Shift+Enter keybinding conflict when running `/ide` command
- **Cursor Integration Discovery**:
  - Cursor has its own Claude Code extension installed
  - Extension runs MCP server on port 29389
  - May be launching different Claude instance than terminal

### [June 12, 2025 03:00 AM] Root Cause Hypothesis
- **Primary Issue**: Multiple Claude Code instances creating conflicts
- **Secondary Issue**: Cursor's Claude button bypasses existing session context
- **Keybinding Conflict**: Indicates multiple instances trying to register same shortcuts
- **Next Investigation Steps**:
  1. Determine which Claude instance Cursor launches
  2. Find how to configure Cursor to use correct instance
  3. Investigate keybinding registration conflicts
  4. Test unification strategies

### [June 12, 2025 03:30 AM] Comprehensive Investigation Complete
After thorough investigation, identified root cause and developed fix plan.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS - FINAL ANALYSIS

### 1. Multiple Claude Code CLI Installations (ROOT CAUSE)
**Confirmed 3 installations:**
- **Global v1.0.21** at `/home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/claude` ✅ KEEP (latest)
- **Local v1.0.17** at `/home/spide/.claude/local/` ❌ REMOVE (outdated wrapper)
- **Cursor Extension v1.0.17** at `~/.cursor-server/extensions/anthropic.claude-code-1.0.17/` ✅ KEEP (just a launcher)

**Key Discovery**: Cursor extension is NOT a separate Claude installation - it's just a VS Code extension that launches whatever `claude` command is in PATH.

### 2. Running Claude Processes Analysis
**6 Active Claude processes identified:**
1. **PID 532436 (pts/18)** ⚠️ CURRENT SESSION - DO NOT TERMINATE
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/GitHub/ALNTool`
   - This is our active session!

2. **PID 29465 (pts/14)** - Started Jun 10, Sleeping
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/About Last Night/ALNDive_Synthesis_GameUnderstanding`
   - Old session, can be terminated

3. **PID 79406 (no tty)** - Started Jun 10, Background
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/GitHub/ALNTool`
   - Likely from closed Cursor session, can be terminated

4. **PID 437331 (pts/5)** - Started Jun 11, Sleeping
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/About Last Night/balance`
   - Minimal activity (0.1% CPU), can be terminated

5. **PID 461477 (pts/10)** - Started Jun 11, RUNNING
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/About Last Night/balance`
   - Active (2.9% CPU), check before terminating

6. **PID 531569 (pts/17)** - Started Jun 11, Sleeping
   - Working Dir: `/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/GitHub/ALNTool`
   - Recent file access, check before terminating

### 3. Keybinding Conflict Source
- NOT from Cursor extension (it uses Ctrl+Escape, not Shift+Enter)
- Caused by multiple Claude CLI instances trying to register same keybindings
- Will be resolved when duplicate installations are removed

### 4. MCP Configuration Status
- Claude Desktop: 5 servers configured and working
- Claude CLI: Has 2 project-scoped servers in ALNTool directory
- Scope-based storage confirmed - need to use user scope for global access

## FINAL FIX PLAN

### Phase 1: Save Important Context
**Before proceeding, check these sessions for important work:**
- ALNDive_Synthesis_GameUnderstanding project (PID 29465)
- balance project (PIDs 437331, 461477) - especially 461477 which is actively running
- ALNTool sessions (PIDs 531569, 79406)

### Phase 2: Process Cleanup
```bash
# Terminate old processes (EXCLUDING current session 532436)
for pid in 29465 79406 437331 461477 531569; do
    echo "Terminating PID $pid..."
    kill $pid 2>/dev/null || echo "Process $pid already terminated"
done
```

### Phase 3: Installation Cleanup
```bash
# Remove outdated local installation
rm -rf ~/.claude/local/

# Verify global installation is primary
which claude  # Should show: /home/spide/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/claude
claude --version  # Should show: 1.0.21 (Claude Code)
```

### Phase 4: MCP Configuration (from home directory for user scope)
```bash
cd ~

# Add all MCP servers with proper configuration
claude mcp add github "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github" --env "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=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"

claude mcp add filesystem "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents"

claude mcp add notionApi "npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server" --env 'OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS={"Authorization": "Bearer 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", "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"}'

claude mcp add desktop-commander "npx -y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest"

claude mcp add playwright "npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --config /mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/GitHub/ALNTool/storyforge/frontend/playwright-mcp-config.json" --cwd "/mnt/c/Users/spide/Documents/GitHub/ALNTool/storyforge/frontend"

# Verify all servers are available
claude mcp list
```

### Phase 5: Verification & Testing
1. **Test Claude CLI**: `claude` command should work with all MCP servers
2. **Test Cursor Integration**: Claude button should use the global v1.0.21 installation
3. **Verify No Conflicts**: No more Shift+Enter keybinding errors
4. **Check Single Version**: Only one Claude Code CLI installation remains

### Phase 6: Update Windows Claude Desktop Config (if needed)
If MCP servers in Windows need path updates for WSL compatibility, update the paths but keep using Windows-native commands.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ Only one Claude Code CLI installation (v1.0.21 global)
- ✅ No keybinding conflicts
- ✅ All MCP servers available in Claude CLI
- ✅ Cursor uses the global installation
- ✅ Seamless workflow: terminal → /ide → Cursor → back

## RECOVERY PLAN
If current session (PID 532436) is accidentally terminated:
1. All findings are documented in this report
2. The fix plan is complete and can be executed in a new session
3. No data will be lost - only running processes will be affected
