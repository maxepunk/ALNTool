Hey Alex,
Can you get me on the guestlist for the rave too? Maybe we can do some digging together and take that asshole down….

Hey James,
It’s been too long, let’s grab coffee soon to catch up, would love to hear more about what you’re doing at AI BioComp.
Not exactly sure about Marcus’s deal with Victoria. He kinda iced me out after we sold BizAI, which is so ironic since I’m the one who got screwed over in that deal, despite having done all the work. Anyways, I’m actually chatting with Victoria soon, gonna meet up with her at Marcus’s next rave. I’ll let you know if I find anything.

Hey Alex,
It’s been a while since YC, hope you’re doing well. Look, I know that Marcus started NeurAI without you, but I’m wondering if you have any info about him or the company that might be useful to me. As you probably know, Victoria Kingsly funded both my company and Marcus’s, but somehow, even though my company is doing so much better than his, he’s secured a ton of funding from her for his next round and she won’t give me the time of the day.
