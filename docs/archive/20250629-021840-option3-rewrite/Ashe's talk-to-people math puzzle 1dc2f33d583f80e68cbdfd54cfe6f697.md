Description/Solution: Ashe has to talk to several players to find out their birthday info (which are in their character sheets) and then do some math to find the code to their pouch. 

When unlocked, there’s a business card for the black market

Ashe, I think you might have some info that'd be valuable to my friend. I know you uncovered a lot of secrets writing that expose about Marcus Blackwood that no publication will print. I've left my friend's card here in this pouch and the code to unlock it is the month of James Whitman's birthday plus the year of Victoria Kingsley's birthday plus the date of Sarah Blackwood's birthday plus the date of Derek Thorne/s birthday plus the year of Alex Reeves’ birth”

James: 05/08/1993
Victoria: 07/02/1962
Sarah: 06/04/1989
Derek: 07/26/1989
Alex: 11/12/1990

5+1962+04+26+1990

ANSWER: 3987
