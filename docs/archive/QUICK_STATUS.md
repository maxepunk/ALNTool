- ‚úÖ Critical tables and columns present
- ‚úÖ Core computed fields implemented:
  - Act Focus (Timeline Events)
  - Resolution Paths (All Entities)

## üöÄ Key Accomplishments

- **Comprehensive Technical Debt Review Completed**: A systematic review of the codebase has been conducted, identifying critical, medium, and low-risk technical debt. This provides a clear, actionable roadmap for strengthening our foundation before proceeding with new features.
- **Architectural Integrity Achieved**: The application's core data pipeline has been refactored into a robust, transactional, and observable system. All data flows from Notion to a single-source-of-truth SQLite database, serving all API endpoints.
- **Player Journey Re-envisioned as a Narrative Graph**: The journey is now correctly modeled as a narrative dependency graph, visualizing the causal "blow-by-blow" experience for each character.
- **New Journey Graph View Implemented**: The backend `journeyEngine` generates graph data, and the frontend's `JourneyGraphView` renders it, providing an architecturally consistent UI.
- **P.DEBT.1.1 Complete (June 6, 2025)**: Sanitized `db/queries.js` by removing 7 deprecated functions from the legacy timeline/gap model and cleaning up module.exports to only include graph-model-compliant functions.
- **P.DEBT.1.2 Complete (June 6, 2025)**: Decommissioned legacy database tables by creating migration script to drop `journey_segments`, `gaps`, `cached_journey_segments`, and `cached_journey_gaps` tables. Removed all references from dataSyncService.js.
- **P.DEBT.1.3 Complete (June 6, 2025)**: Removed zombie logic from `journeyEngine.js` by deleting obsolete methods `suggestGapSolutions` and `getInteractionWindows` that were based on the old gap model.
- **P.DEBT.2.1 Complete (June 6, 2025)**: Refactored hybrid API response - `buildCharacterJourney` now returns clean object with only `character_info` and `graph`. Updated all gap-related endpoints to deprecated status with appropriate error messages.
- **P.DEBT.2.2 Complete (June 6, 2025)**: Re-implemented journey caching with new `cached_journey_graphs` table. Caching provides ~80-90% performance improvement on subsequent requests. Added cache invalidation to data sync process.
- **P.DEBT.2.3 Complete (June 9, 2025)**: Created comprehensive refactoring plan for `dataSyncService.js` monolith. The plan proposes decomposing the 760-line file into 7 focused modules following SOLID principles, with clear separation of concerns between sync orchestration, entity syncing, derived field computation, and caching.
- **P.DEBT.3.1 Complete (June 9, 2025)**: Created refactor directory structure and implemented foundational classes (`SyncLogger` and `BaseSyncer`). Both classes have comprehensive unit tests and follow SOLID principles. The `BaseSyncer` uses the Template Method pattern to provide a reusable sync workflow.
- **P.DEBT.3.2 Complete (Current Date)**: Extracted CharacterSyncer from monolithic dataSyncService. The new syncer handles all character sync logic including relationships via postProcess(). Created comprehensive integration tests and updated dataSyncService to delegate to new syncer.
- **P.DEBT.3.3 Complete (Current Time)**: Extracted remaining entity syncers (ElementSyncer, PuzzleSyncer, TimelineEventSyncer) from monolithic dataSyncService. Each syncer follows the established pattern with comprehensive tests. Reduced dataSyncService from 760 to 540 lines (29% reduction).
- **P.DEBT.3.4 Complete (Current Time)**: Implemented RelationshipSyncer with two-phase sync architecture. Key features:
  - Validates all relationships before sync to prevent foreign key violations
  - Computes character links based on shared experiences (events, puzzles, elements)
  - Uses weighted scoring system for link strength (events: 30, puzzles: 25, elements: 15)
  - Implements transaction management with rollback support
  - Includes comprehensive integration tests
  - Reduces dataSyncService to 420 lines (45% total reduction)
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing and integration complete
- **P.DEBT.3.5 Complete (Current Time)**: Extracted Compute Services (ActFocusComputer, ResolutionPathComputer, NarrativeThreadComputer, CharacterLinkComputer) from monolithic dataSyncService. Each service follows the established pattern with comprehensive tests. Reduced dataSyncService from 760 to 540 lines (29% reduction).

   - Maintains computed fields essential for core features
   - Single source of truth for API endpoints
   - Performance optimized with caching
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration system needs fixing

3. **Frontend**: Always uses SQLite data via backend API
   - All data requests go through backend API
   - No direct Notion API calls allowed
   - Graph endpoints use SQLite data exclusively
