# Archive Directory Structure

This directory contains historical documentation that has been archived to maintain a clean, accurate documentation system.

## Archive Organization

### `/completed/`
Contains documentation about work that has been finished and no longer needs active reference:

- **DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_HANDOFF.md** - Documentation alignment phase completion summary

### `/deprecated/`
Contains documentation with outdated phase systems or false claims that were causing confusion:

- **PROGRESS_REVIEW.md** - Contains deprecated "Phase 4+" and "Final Mile" references
- **CODE_AUDIT_2025.md** - Contains false "Phase 4+ system" claims

### `/tech-debt/`
Contains completed technical debt documentation from the P.DEBT.X.X system:

- **FINAL_MILE_GUIDE.md** - Deprecated "Final Mile" concept
- **PHASE_4_PLAN.md** - Deprecated phase system
- **REFACTOR_PLAN_DATASYNC.md** - Completed refactoring plans
- **TECH_DEBT_LOG.md** - Historical debt tracking
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Historical troubleshooting guide

### Other Archive Directories

- **`/assessments/`** - Historical assessments and analysis
- **`/design/`** - Game design background materials
- **`/doc-alignment-phase/`** - Documentation alignment work artifacts
- **`/handoff/`** - Session handoff materials
- **`/reports/`** - Various project reports
- **`/requirements/`** - Historical requirements documentation
- **`/sessions/`** - Session-specific documentation

## Why Files Were Archived

### Multiple Phase System Confusion
The project suffered from multiple conflicting phase numbering systems:

1. **Original Development Phases** (Sprint 1-5) - June-July 2024
2. **P.DEBT.X.X System** - August-November 2024
3. **"Phase 0.5 - Critical Stabilization"** - November 2024
4. **"Final Mile" References** - Documentation drift
5. **False "Phase 4+" Claims** - Aspirational language

### Solution: Single Source of Truth
- **Current System**: Architecture Remediation Phases (December 2024)
- **Single Tracker**: [PHASE_TRACKER.md](../PHASE_TRACKER.md)
- **Archive Policy**: Move conflicting references to maintain accuracy

## Archive Policy

**Files are archived when they:**
- Contain deprecated phase system references
- Make false claims about project status
- Document completed work that no longer needs active reference
- Cause confusion in the current documentation system

**Files stay active when they:**
- Provide current, accurate information
- Support ongoing development work
- Contain valid historical context without false claims

## Accessing Archived Content

Archived content remains available for historical reference but should not be used for current development decisions. For current project status, use:

- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Current status and navigation
- **[PHASE_TRACKER.md](../PHASE_TRACKER.md)** - Current phase system
- **[DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md](../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md)** - Implementation guide
