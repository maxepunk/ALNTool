# üìö Streamlined Documentation System
## Stop Getting Lost - Start Building

### The Problem We Solved
Too many documents = confusion. We've consolidated everything into a clear hierarchy that follows the DRY principle.

---

## üéØ The Documentation Hierarchy

### Layer 1: Core Development Docs (Daily Use)

These 3 documents contain everything needed for active development:

1. **QUICK_STATUS.md** 
   - **Purpose**: Where you are right now  
   - **When**: Every morning (30 seconds)
   - **Content**: Current task, progress, next steps

2. **DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md** ‚≠ê
   - **Purpose**: How to build it (your main guide)  
   - **When**: ALWAYS OPEN WHILE CODING
   - **Content**: Implementation details, code snippets, acceptance criteria

3. **PRODUCTION_INTELLIGENCE_TOOL_PRD.md**
   - **Purpose**: What you're building (specifications)  
   - **When**: Need UI/UX reference or architecture questions
   - **Content**: Complete requirements, mockups, system design

### Layer 2: Game Context (As Needed)

For understanding the game mechanics when implementing features:

- **active_synthesis_streamlined.md** - Complete game design
- **concept_evolution_streamlined.md** - Design decisions explained  
- **questions_log_streamlined.md** - Clarifications and open questions

### Layer 3: Technical References (When Stuck)

- **SCHEMA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md** - Notion‚ÜíSQL field mappings
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common problems and solutions

## üéØ The New System: Just 3 Documents

### 1. **PRODUCTION_INTELLIGENCE_TOOL_PRD.md**
**Purpose**: What you're building (specifications)  
**When to read**: 
- First time on project
- Need UI/UX reference
- Architecture questions

### 2. **DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md** ‚≠ê
**Purpose**: How to build it (your main guide)  
**When to read**:
- **ALWAYS OPEN WHILE CODING**
- Contains every implementation detail
- Exact code snippets
- File paths
- Acceptance criteria

### 3. **QUICK_STATUS.md** 
**Purpose**: Where you are right now  
**When to read**:
- Every morning (takes 30 seconds)
- After completing a task
- When returning from break

---

## üîÑ Your Daily Workflow

### Morning (2 minutes)
1. Open **QUICK_STATUS.md**
2. See your current task
3. Open **DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md** to that task
4. Start coding

### While Coding
- **DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md** stays open
- Follow the implementation exactly
- Check off acceptance criteria as you go
- Copy code snippets directly

### Evening (2 minutes)
1. Update **QUICK_STATUS.md** if task complete
2. Commit with milestone reference
3. Close laptop

---

## üö® When You're Lost

**STOP** and ask yourself:

1. **What task am I on?**  
   ‚Üí Check QUICK_STATUS.md (10 seconds)

2. **What exactly should I code?**  
   ‚Üí Check DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md for that task (30 seconds)

3. **What should it look like?**  
   ‚Üí Check PRD Section 7 for UI specs (when needed)

That's it. No other documents needed.

---

## üìù What About the Other Documents?

### Keep These:
- **README.md** - Project setup and overview
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Only when stuck
- **SCHEMA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md** - Field mapping reference
- **game design background/** folder - Deep game understanding

### Archive/Delete These:
- PHASE_MILESTONES.md ‚ùå
- PHASE_1_DETAILED_MILESTONES.md ‚ùå  
- PHASE_1_COMPLETE_BREAKDOWN.md ‚ùå
- PHASE_2_MICRO_MILESTONES.md ‚ùå
- MICRO_MILESTONE_GUIDE.md ‚ùå
- DAILY_CHECKLIST.md ‚ùå (workflow is now simpler)
- DEVELOPER_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md ‚ùå
- Original DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md ‚ùå

They're all consolidated into the DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK now.

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK has ALL implementation details
2. **Current Context**: QUICK_STATUS tells you exactly where you are
3. **No Duplication**: Information exists in exactly one place
4. **Action-Oriented**: Every section tells you what to DO, not just what to know

---

## üéØ Implementation Tips

### Good Practice
```bash
# Your browser tabs while working:
Tab 1: QUICK_STATUS.md
Tab 2: DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md (scrolled to current task)
Tab 3: Your code editor
Tab 4: Running application
```

### Bad Practice
- Having 10 documentation files open
- Searching multiple docs for the same info  
- Not knowing which document is authoritative
- Reading about tasks you're not working on

---

## üöÄ Getting Started Right Now

1. **Close all documentation except**:
   - QUICK_STATUS.md
   - DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md
   - This guide

2. **Read QUICK_STATUS.md** (30 seconds)

3. **Open DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md** to your current task

4. **Start coding**

**‚ö° Current Priority**: Implementing computed fields (Act Focus, Resolution Paths, etc.) - see SCHEMA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md for details. These unlock core PRD features.

## üìä Measuring Success

You know the system is working when:
- ‚úÖ You always know what task you're on
- ‚úÖ You can find implementation details in <30 seconds  
- ‚úÖ You're not jumping between documents
- ‚úÖ You're writing code, not reading docs

---

Remember: **Confusion means you're in the wrong document.** There are only 3, so it's easy to get back on track.
