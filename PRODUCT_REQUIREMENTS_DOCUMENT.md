# ALNTool Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version**: 2.0 - TDD-Driven Development  
**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Status**: Primary Design Environment for About Last Night  
**Authors**: Development Team

---

## Executive Summary

ALNTool is evolving from a design decision support system into **the primary design and production environment** for the "About Last Night" murder mystery game. It will ultimately replace direct Notion editing, providing a unified interface where game designers create, modify, and analyze all game content with real-time impact intelligence.

**Current State**: Sophisticated intelligence layers built, but missing critical edges and UX fundamentals. Aggregation removed in favor of visual hierarchy.

**Target State**: Complete design environment that starts as read-only intelligence and evolves into the primary tool for creating and managing the entire game.

---

## Product Vision

### The Evolution Path

```
Phase 1: Design Decision Support (Read-Only) ‚Üê CURRENT
Phase 2: Real-Time Content Creation (Preview Mode)  
Phase 3: Integrated Design Environment (Replace Notion Editing)
Phase 4: Collaborative Design Platform (Multi-User Creation)
```

### What ALNTool Will Become
- **Phase 1**: Intelligence tool showing impact of any change
- **Phase 2**: Creation tool with live impact preview  
- **Phase 3**: Primary design environment replacing Notion UI
- **Phase 4**: Collaborative platform for entire team

### Core Philosophy
- **Design Tool First**: Built for incomplete/evolving game data
- **Intelligence Embedded**: Every action shows consequences
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple interface, deep capabilities
- **Notion Integration**: Notion remains data store, ALNTool becomes the interface

## The Game Context: About Last Night

### Game Structure
1. **Act 1**: Social investigation through forced collaboration (60-90 minutes)
2. **Revelation Scene**: Game transforms when memory tokens discovered
3. **Act 2**: Three-way prisoner's dilemma with economic choices

### Key Mechanics
- **Social Choreography**: Puzzles require elements from other players
- **Memory Economy**: Tokens have values affecting player choices
- **Narrative Discovery**: Timeline events revealed through elements
- **Production Reality**: Physical props, RFID tokens, scanner logistics

### Design Challenges
Designers must balance four dimensions simultaneously:
- **Story**: What happened and how players discover it
- **Social**: Which players must interact and when
- **Economic**: Token values and path balance
- **Production**: Physical props and dependencies

**Phase 1 Needs** (Intelligence):
- "If Victoria's affair is worth $5000, how does that affect choices?"
- "Which characters discover this revelation?"

**Phase 2 Needs** (Creation Preview):

- "Is the reward value balanced?"

**Phase 2 Needs** (Creation Preview):
- "Test different element requirements before committing"
- "Preview how puzzle changes cascade"

**Phase 3 Needs** (Primary Tool):

- "Drag-and-drop element requirements"

**Phase 4 Needs** (Collaboration):
- "Lock this puzzle while I redesign it"
- "Notify Sarah her character is affected"

## Current System Analysis

### Architecture Status
```
Notion (Data Store - Source of Truth)
    ‚Üì 
Backend Sync (Complete - All Relationships Captured)
    ‚Üì
SQLite Database (Complete Data Model)
    ‚Üì
API Layer (BROKEN - Only Character Links Exposed)
    ‚Üì
Frontend (Ready but Data-Starved)
    ‚Üì
Visualization (No Aggregation - Visual Hierarchy Only)
```

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing 80% of Edges
- **Have**: Character-character relationships only
- **Missing**: Ownership, containers, requirements, rewards, revelations
- **Impact**: Can't see puzzle dependencies or element flow

#### 2. Entity Selection Broken
- Node IDs overwrite entity IDs
- Click handlers corrupt selection state
- Intelligence panel receives wrong data

#### 3. Visual Hierarchy Implementation
- Successfully removed aggregation logic
- Using opacity/scale/blur for 400+ nodes
- But missing proper force-directed layout

#### 4. No Search or Progressive Loading
- Shows all 400+ nodes immediately
- No way to find specific entities
- Overwhelming initial experience

## Data Model & Relationships

### Entity Structure
```typescript
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  entityCategory: 'character' | 'element' | 'puzzle' | 'timeline';
  // Common fields for all entities
}

interface Character extends Entity {
  tier: 'Core' | 'Major' | 'Supporting';
  characterType: 'Player' | 'NPC';
  logline?: string;
}

interface Element extends Entity {

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture (Current Focus)
```
Visual System:
- No aggregation - all nodes always visible
- Visual hierarchy through opacity/scale
- Force-directed layout with D3
- Custom node components per type

State Management:
- Zustand: UI state only
- React Query: Server data
- localStorage: User preferences

Performance:
- Progressive loading
- React.memo optimization
- Viewport culling
- Edge bundling
```

### API Requirements (Must Fix)
```
Current (Broken):
GET /api/character-links ‚úì (only working endpoint)

Required for Phase 1:
GET /api/elements/relationships
GET /api/puzzles/dependencies
GET /api/timeline/connections
GET /api/entities/full-graph

Required for Phase 2:
POST /api/preview/impact
POST /api/validate/balance
GET /api/suggestions/content

Required for Phase 3:
PUT /api/entities/:id
POST /api/entities
DELETE /api/entities/:id
POST /api/sync/notion
```

## Test-Driven Development Strategy

### 1. Behavioral Tests (Design Tool Resilience)
```javascript
describe('Design Tool Core Behaviors', () => {
  // Don't test specific counts, test patterns
  test('handles any number of entities without crashing');
  test('shows relationships that exist in data');
  test('selection works regardless of entity type');
  test('visual hierarchy adapts to data scale');
});
```

### 2. Edge Generation Tests
```javascript
describe('Relationship Visualization', () => {
  test('generates ownership edges when owner exists');
  test('skips edges with missing endpoints');
  test('shows all relationship types from API');
  test('handles circular references gracefully');
});
```

### 3. User Workflow Tests
```javascript
describe('Designer User Journeys', () => {
  test('search and select entity in <5 seconds');
  test('see complete impact analysis immediately');
  test('preview changes before saving (Phase 2)');
  test('collaborate without conflicts (Phase 4)');
});
```

### 4. Progressive Capability Tests
```javascript
describe('Phased Feature Delivery', () => {
  test('Phase 1: Read-only intelligence works completely');
  test('Phase 2: Creation preview without breaking Phase 1');
  test('Phase 3: Editing without losing intelligence');
  test('Phase 4: Collaboration layer non-invasive');
});
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Missing Edges**: Implement defensive edge generation
- **Performance**: Visual hierarchy proven to work
- **Notion Limits**: Batch operations, smart caching

### Evolution Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase gates
- **Breaking Changes**: Each phase preserves previous
- **User Trust**: Notion remains source of truth

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Start with familiar intelligence
- **Migration Anxiety**: Gradual feature introduction
- **Team Buy-in**: Show value at each phase

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Phase 1 Must Be Complete**: No moving forward without solid foundation
2. **Each Phase Preserves Previous**: Never break working features
3. **User Testing at Each Gate**: Validate before proceeding
4. **Performance First**: 400+ nodes must always be smooth
5. **Notion Integration**: Respect source of truth

---

## Conclusion

ALNTool is not just a visualization or intelligence tool - it's evolving into the primary design environment for About Last Night. By building in phases from read-only intelligence to full collaborative creation, we ensure each step delivers value while maintaining stability.

The key differentiator is that we're building a **design tool for evolving game data**, not a database management system. Every feature must support game designers in understanding impact, making decisions, and creating content with confidence.
