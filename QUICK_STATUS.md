# Quick Status Check
## Where Are You Right Now?

**Last Updated**: 2024-07-26
**Current Task**: P1.M2.4: Implement Journey Caching in Database
**File You Should Be In**: `storyforge/backend/src/services/journeyEngine.js` (and `storyforge/backend/src/db/queries.js`)
**Branch**: `feature/production-intelligence-tool`

---

## 🎯 Your Current Focus

### What You're Building
Implement a caching mechanism for computed character journeys. `buildCharacterJourney` should first attempt to retrieve a journey from the database. If a valid cached journey exists, return it. Otherwise, compute the journey and then save the results (segments and gaps) to the database.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist (from DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md for P1.M2.4)
- [ ] `buildCharacterJourney` first attempts to retrieve a computed journey from the database.
- [ ] If cached journey is found and valid, it's returned without re-computation.
- [ ] If no valid cached journey, it's computed and then the results are stored in the database.

### Code You Need
```javascript
// In storyforge/backend/src/services/journeyEngine.js (Conceptual)
// async buildCharacterJourney(characterId) {
//   const cached = await dbQueries.getCachedJourney(characterId);
//   if (cached && isValid(cached)) return cached;
//
//   const journey = await this.computeNewJourney(characterId);
//   await dbQueries.saveCachedJourney(characterId, journey);
//   return journey;
// }

// In storyforge/backend/src/db/queries.js (Conceptual)
// async function getCachedJourney(characterId) { /* ... */ }
// async function saveCachedJourney(characterId, journeyData) { /* ... */ }
```

## ✅ What's Done

### Phase 1: Foundation 🚧 (In Progress - Current Active Phase)
- ✅ P1.M4: Frontend State Foundation
- ✅ P1.M1: SQLite Database Layer (P1.M1.1 Dependencies ✅, P1.M1.2 Schema ✅, P1.M1.3 Robust Migrations ✅)
- 🚧 P1.M2: Journey Engine (Current Milestone: P1.M2.4 Caching ⏳)
- 🚧 P1.M3: API Endpoints (P1.M3.2 POST /resolve ⏳)
*(Note: Initial setups for DB, Journey Engine, Gaps, APIs were done, but key foundational tasks are now active.)*

### Phase 2: Core Views 🚧 (Partially Started)
- ✅ P2.M1.1: Basic Timeline Structure
- ✅ P2.M1.2: Segment Visualization (with notes on implementation differences)
- ✅ P2.M1.3: Timeline Interactivity
- 🚧 P2.M1.4: Gap Highlighting & Selection (Partially Implemented)
*(Work on P2.M1.4 may proceed but Phase 1 foundational tasks are primary focus.)*
