# Quick Status Check
## Where Are You Right Now?

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Current Task**: P1.M1.3 - Implement Robust Migration System
**File You Should Be In**: `backend/src/db/migrations.js` (and potentially `backend/src/db/migration-scripts/`)
**Branch**: `feature/production-intelligence-tool`

---

## 🎯 Your Current Focus

### What You're Building
Implement a robust database migration system. This involves creating a `schema_migrations` table, logic to apply pending SQL migration scripts from a designated directory, and establishing an initial baseline migration.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist (from DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md for P1.M1.3)
- [ ] `schema_migrations` table is created and used to track applied migrations.
- [ ] System can apply new SQL migration scripts from a designated directory.
- [ ] Initial schema is successfully established via the first migration script.
- [ ] `runMigrations` function correctly brings the database schema to the latest version.

### Code You Need
```javascript
// In backend/src/db/migrations.js (Conceptual)
// function applyMigration(scriptName, scriptContent) { /* ... */ }
// function getAppliedMigrations() { /* ... */ }
// function runMigrations() {
//   // 1. Ensure schema_migrations table exists
//   // 2. Read scripts from migration-scripts/
//   // 3. Compare with applied migrations
//   // 4. Execute pending scripts & record them
// }
```

## ✅ What's Done

### Phase 1: Foundation 🚧 (In Progress - Current Active Phase)
- ✅ P1.M4: Frontend State Foundation
- 🚧 P1.M1: SQLite Database Layer (Current Milestone: P1.M1.3 Robust Migrations ⏳)
- 🚧 P1.M2: Journey Engine (P1.M2.4 Caching ⏳)
- 🚧 P1.M3: API Endpoints (P1.M3.2 POST /resolve ⏳)
*(Note: Initial setups for DB, Journey Engine, Gaps, APIs were done, but key foundational tasks are now active.)*

### Phase 2: Core Views 🚧 (Partially Started)
- ✅ P2.M1.1: Basic Timeline Structure
- ✅ P2.M1.2: Segment Visualization (with notes on implementation differences)
- ✅ P2.M1.3: Timeline Interactivity
- 🚧 P2.M1.4: Gap Highlighting & Selection (Partially Implemented)
*(Work on P2.M1.4 may proceed but Phase 1 foundational tasks are primary focus.)*
