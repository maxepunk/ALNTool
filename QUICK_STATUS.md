# Quick Status & Handoff Notes

**Last Updated**: [Current Date]
**Focus**: **Technical Debt Repayment & Architectural Solidification**

## 🚀 Key Accomplishments

- **Comprehensive Technical Debt Review Completed**: A systematic review of the codebase has been conducted, identifying critical, medium, and low-risk technical debt. This provides a clear, actionable roadmap for strengthening our foundation before proceeding with new features.
- **Architectural Integrity Achieved**: The application's core data pipeline has been refactored into a robust, transactional, and observable system. All data flows from Notion to a single-source-of-truth SQLite database, serving all API endpoints.
- **Player Journey Re-envisioned as a Narrative Graph**: The journey is now correctly modeled as a narrative dependency graph, visualizing the causal "blow-by-blow" experience for each character.
- **New Journey Graph View Implemented**: The backend `journeyEngine` generates graph data, and the frontend's `JourneyGraphView` renders it, providing an architecturally consistent UI.

## 🎯 Current Status

- **System Stability**: HIGH. The application is stable.
- **Development Status**: **PAUSED**. All new feature development is on hold. The current and sole priority is to address the technical debt identified in the recent review.
- **Next Steps**: Execute the three-phase technical debt repayment plan outlined in the `DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## 🧑‍💻 Next Steps & Priorities

Our immediate roadmap is the sequential execution of the Technical Debt Repayment Plan.

1.  **🔴 Priority 1: Critical Risk Cleanup (IMMEDIATE FOCUS)**
    -   **Action**: Eradicate all "zombie code"—obsolete functions, queries, and database tables from the legacy timeline/gap model.
    -   **Goal**: Eliminate the risk of developers building on a rotten foundation. Make the codebase accurately reflect the new architecture.

2.  **🟡 Priority 2: Architectural & Performance Polish**
    -   **Action**: Refactor the API response to be consistent, re-implement performance caching, and break down monolithic services.
    -   **Goal**: Improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

3.  **🟢 Priority 3: Documentation & Minor Cleanup**
    -   **Action**: Update all project documentation to align with the narrative graph model and improve logging consistency.
    -   **Goal**: Ensure our documentation is a reliable source of truth.
