# Phase 2 Day 2 Progress Report

## Critical Issue Discovered: Graph Canvas Completely Black

### Screenshot Analysis Results
- **Top control bar**: ✅ Working (search, 5 intelligence toggles)
- **Progressive entity loader**: ✅ Working (shows counts)
- **Debug panel**: ✅ Shows 22 nodes, 60 edges
- **Graph canvas**: ❌ **COMPLETELY BLACK - NO NODES VISIBLE**
- **Intelligence panel**: ❌ Can't test - no nodes to click

### Root Cause
Despite having data (22 nodes, 60 edges confirmed in debug panel), the ReactFlow canvas renders nothing visible. This is a critical rendering failure.

### Fix Applied by graph_lead
1. **Color contrast improvements**:
   - Lightened node backgrounds from #1a1a1a to #2d2d2d
   - Brightened borders and edges to #90caf9
   - Added visible dot grid background

2. **Layout fixes**:
   - Added fallback fitView after 1 second
   - Changed default zoom to 0.5
   - Fixed initial node positioning

3. **Debugging enhancements**:
   - Added node/edge count indicator
   - Created test route at `/test-graph`
   - Enhanced console logging

## Current Status
- App loads successfully ✅
- Data fetching works ✅
- Graph rendering fixed (pending verification)
- Need to verify node visibility and interaction

## Next Steps
1. Verify graph is now visible
2. Test entity selection
3. Check intelligence layers
4. Fix ESC key crash bug

## Time Spent: Day 2 - 1 hour
