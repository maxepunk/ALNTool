        **RELIABILITY FOCUS:**
        Test the things that break in production: API contracts, entity relationships, graph performance, and authentication flows.
        
        For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
