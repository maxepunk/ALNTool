# Phase 2 Initial Findings - UX Implementation

## Current State Assessment

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend server running on port 3000  
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly (/api/metadata returns 200)
- ✅ Build process completes successfully (770KB bundle)

### Critical Issue: App Stuck in Loading State
The application is stuck showing "Loading StoryForge..." with a spinner. Investigation reveals:

1. **API Communication Working**: 
   - `/api/metadata` endpoint returns proper data
   - React Query logs show successful responses

2. **React Query v5 Issue**:
   - Using `@tanstack/react-query: ^5.67.2`
   - The `onSettled` callback in App.jsx is not firing
   - This prevents `setInitialLoading(false)` from being called
   - App remains stuck at line 81-96 of App.jsx

3. **No JavaScript Errors**:
   - Console shows no errors
   - Only deprecation warnings about using old API endpoints

## Immediate Action Required
Before any UX improvements can be tested, we need to fix the loading state issue in App.jsx.
