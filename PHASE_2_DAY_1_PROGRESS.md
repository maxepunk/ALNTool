# Phase 2 Day 1 Progress Report

## Summary of Fixes Completed

### Critical Issues Fixed ✅

1. **App Loading Issue (FIXED)**
   - Changed React Query v5 onSettled to useEffect watching isSuccess/isError
   - Added 5-second timeout fallback
   - App now loads successfully past the spinner

2. **API Import Errors (FIXED)**
   - Fixed all incorrect imports from `import { getCharacters }` to `import { api }`
   - Updated 7 component files and 1 hook file
   - All API calls now use proper `api.methodName()` format

3. **Graph Missing Edges (FIXED)**
   - Identified API field mismatch: backend returns `character_a_id`/`character_b_id`
   - Added field mapping to `source`/`target` in EntityManager
   - Graph now displays 60 edges between 22 character nodes

4. **Entity Selection (WORKING)**
   - Click selection works and shows Intelligence Panel
   - Intelligence Panel displays entity data correctly
   - ESC key clears selection (but causes crash - see issues)

## Current Application State

### What's Working ✅
- App loads and displays main interface
- Graph renders with 22 character nodes
- 60 character relationship edges display
- Entity selection via click
- Intelligence Panel shows entity details
- Progressive entity loading UI present
- Debug panel shows helpful metrics

### What's Not Working ❌
1. **Graph Crash on Clear Selection** (NEW CRITICAL BUG)
   - Error: "node not found: 18c2f33d-583f-802f-9042-d4e989988b6e"
   - Happens when pressing ESC to clear selection
   - Error boundary catches it but graph becomes unusable

2. **Intelligence Layer Toggles**
   - Toggles are visible but don't seem to activate layers
   - Only "Social" toggle appears active by default
   - No visual overlay data appears on graph

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Only ESC key works (and causes crash)
   - Arrow keys, Tab, Enter not implemented

4. **Missing UI Elements**
   - Entity Selector autocomplete not visible
   - No hover tooltips on nodes
   - No multi-select capability

## Screenshots Captured
1. `initial-app-state` - Loading spinner (before fix)
2. `app-loaded-successfully` - After loading fix
3. `graph-with-edges-fixed` - Shows 60 edges rendered
4. `intelligence-panel-working` - Shows entity selection working

## Specialist Performance

### interaction_lead ⭐
- Successfully fixed React Query loading issue in 30 minutes
- Clear understanding of the problem and solution

### graph_lead ⭐
- Fixed all API imports systematically
- Added helpful debug logging and debug panel
- Identified and fixed the edge rendering issue

## Next Priority Tasks

### High Priority
1. Fix graph crash when clearing selection
2. Make intelligence layer toggles functional
3. Implement basic keyboard navigation

### Medium Priority
1. Add hover tooltips
2. Fix entity selector visibility
3. Verify all 5 intelligence layers work

### Low Priority
1. Move computation to backend
2. Update documentation

## Time Spent: ~2 hours

## Recommendation
Continue with fixing the graph crash issue first, as it's a critical blocker. The app is now functional enough to test other features, but this crash makes it fragile.
