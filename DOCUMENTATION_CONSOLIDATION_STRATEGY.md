# ALNTool Documentation Consolidation Strategy

## Executive Summary

After deep analysis of the 130+ documentation files and understanding the true product vision, I recommend a **radical consolidation** that preserves essential knowledge while eliminating confusion.

## The Core Understanding

ALNTool is **design decision support intelligence** for "About Last Night" - a murder mystery game where 20-40 players navigate social puzzles and moral choices. The tool helps designers balance four dimensions (Story, Social, Economic, Production) by showing complete impact analysis when any entity is selected.

## Consolidation Plan

### 1. Create New Structure (3 documents)

```
ALNTool/
├── CLAUDE.md              # AI agent guide (updated with reality)
├── README.md              # Human overview of project
└── docs/
    ├── VISION.md          # Synthesized from 3 UX documents
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # Generated from actual code
    └── DEVELOPMENT.md     # How to contribute
```

### 2. Archive Everything Else

```
.archive/
├── legacy-docs-2025-01-07/    # All 130+ files
├── README.md                  # Explains this is historical
└── .gitignore                 # Prevent AI from reading
```

### 3. Essential Knowledge Synthesis

#### VISION.md (Synthesize from):
- COMPREHENSIVE_UX_UNDERSTANDING.md → Game mechanics and design challenges
- UX_VISION_JOURNEY_FIRST_PHASED.md → Phased implementation approach  
- PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md → User needs and evolution
- VISUAL_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md → Design language and patterns

#### ARCHITECTURE.md (Generate from):
- Actual code inspection
- Working backend sync pipeline
- Real API endpoints
- Actual frontend components

#### DEVELOPMENT.md:
- Setup instructions that work
- Actual test commands
- Real development workflow
- Current issues and roadmap

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Preserves Vision
The UX documents contain irreplaceable understanding of the game design challenge. We synthesize this knowledge into VISION.md rather than lose it in 130 files.

### 2. Reflects Reality
Instead of fixing 130 conflicting documents, we generate fresh documentation from code reality.

### 3. Enables Progress
With 3 clear documents instead of 130 conflicting ones, developers can actually make progress.

### 4. AI-Optimized
Claude Code can work effectively with 3 authoritative documents vs. getting confused by contradictions.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Archive (30 min)
```bash
mkdir -p .archive/legacy-docs-2025-01-07
mv *.md .archive/legacy-docs-2025-01-07/
mv storyforge/frontend/docs .archive/legacy-docs-2025-01-07/frontend-docs
mv storyforge/frontend/analysis .archive/legacy-docs-2025-01-07/frontend-analysis
# ... etc
```

### Step 2: Synthesize Vision (2 hours)
Create VISION.md combining:
- Game mechanics understanding
- Design challenges  
- User needs
- Phased approach
- Visual design system

### Step 3: Generate Architecture (1 hour)
Inspect code to document:
- What actually exists
- How it actually works
- Real API endpoints
- Actual data flow

### Step 4: Write Development Guide (30 min)
Document:
- Actual setup steps
- Real test commands
- Known issues
- Next steps

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero conflicts**: No contradictory information
2. **Complete vision**: Game understanding preserved
3. **Accurate architecture**: Matches actual code
4. **Actionable guidance**: Developers can work effectively
5. **AI-friendly**: Claude Code gets consistent information

## The Choice

We can either:
- Spend days reconciling 130 conflicting documents
- Or spend 4 hours creating 3 accurate ones

The vision documents showed me what we're building. The code analysis showed me what exists. Let's document reality while preserving the vision.
