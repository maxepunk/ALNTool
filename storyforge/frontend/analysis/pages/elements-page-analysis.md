## 2. API Endpoints Used

### 2.1 Primary Data Endpoints
```javascript
// Get elements with server-side filters
api.getElements(filters) 
// GET /elements?type=X&status=Y&firstAvailable=Z
```

### 2.2 Supporting Endpoints
```javascript
// Get game constants for filter options
api.getGameConstants()
// GET /game-constants
```

### 2.3 Detail View Endpoints (from ElementDetail.jsx)
```javascript
// Get single element details
api.getElementById(id)
// GET /elements/:id

// Get element relationship graph
api.getElementGraph(id, depth)
// GET /elements/:id/graph?depth=2
```

## 3. Data Displayed

### 3.1 Table Columns (ElementTableColumns.jsx)
- **Name**: Element name (sortable)
- **Type**: Basic type with color-coded chips (Memory types get warning color + brain emoji)
- **Act Focus**: Which act the element belongs to (chip display)
- **Status**: Production status with color coding
- **First Available**: When element becomes available
- **Themes**: Multiple theme tags as chips
- **Memory Sets**: Memory set associations as chips

### 3.2 Element Properties (from detail view)
- Basic properties: name, basicType, status, firstAvailable, revealedBy
- Memory-specific: parsed_sf_rfid field for RFID tokens
- Relationships: container, contents, associatedCharacters, timelineEvents
- Puzzle connections: requiredFor, rewardedBy
- Text content: description, productionNotes

### 3.3 Analytics Metrics (useElementAnalytics hook)
- Total element count
- Memory token statistics (total, ready, in development)
- Production status breakdown
- Act distribution counts
- Type distribution
- Production issues/warnings

## 4. Journey Dependencies

### 4.1 Direct Journey Relationships
- **Timeline Event Connection**: Elements can have `timeline_event_id` foreign key (reveals story)
- **Character Associations**: Elements linked to characters (ownership/access)
- **Puzzle Requirements**: Elements required to solve puzzles (creates forced interactions)
- **Puzzle Rewards**: Elements received as puzzle rewards (distribution mechanism)
- **Container Hierarchy**: Elements can contain other elements (nested dependencies)

### 4.2 Economic Impact
- **Memory Token Value**: Calculated memory value for tokens
- **Group Multipliers**: Set bonuses affect economic choices
- **Target Token Count**: Production must meet minimum economy requirements

### 4.3 Social Choreography Dependencies
- **Element Ownership**: Which character has/needs each element
- **Cross-Character Requirements**: Puzzles requiring elements from different characters
- **Collaboration Forcing**: Element dependencies create social interactions

## 5. UI Components & Patterns

### 5.1 Component Structure
```
Elements.jsx (Main Page)
├── PageHeader (Title + Actions)
├── ElementDashboardCards (4 metric cards)
├── ElementProductionAlert (Warning system)
├── ElementFilters (Multi-criteria filtering)
└── DataTable (Reusable table component)
    └── elementTableColumns (Column definitions)
```

### 5.2 State Management
- **React Query**: Data fetching with caching (`staleTime: 5min, cacheTime: 10min`)
- **URL State**: Element type filter persisted in URL params
- **Local State**: All other filters managed locally
- **Derived State**: Client-side filtering after server fetch

### 5.3 UI Patterns
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during fetch
- **Error Handling**: Alert component with retry option
- **Empty States**: Contextual messages based on filter state
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adjusts for mobile/desktop
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded chips for status/type
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Tab-based detail view

## 6. What Serves Journey Design vs General Data

### 6.1 Journey-Relevant Features
✅ **Timeline Event Connections**: Shows which elements reveal story events  
✅ **Character Associations**: Displays element ownership/access paths  
✅ **Puzzle Dependencies**: Lists which puzzles require/reward each element  
✅ **Memory Token Tracking**: Economic impact on player choices  
✅ **Container Relationships**: Element accessibility chains  
✅ **Act Focus**: Temporal availability for journey pacing  

### 6.2 General Production Data
❌ **Basic Status Tracking**: General production pipeline status  
❌ **Type Categorization**: Organizational classification  
❌ **Production Notes**: Implementation details for builders  
❌ **Theme Tags**: Aesthetic/narrative grouping  
❌ **RFID Technical Data**: Physical production specifics  

### 6.3 Key Journey Design Questions This Page Helps Answer
1. "Which elements reveal timeline events about Victoria's affair?"
2. "What memory tokens are available in Act 2 for economic pressure?"
3. "Which character has access to this critical element?"
4. "If this element is missing, which puzzles break?"
5. "How many high-value tokens exist for Black Market path?"

## 7. Integration Opportunities for Journey Intelligence

### 7.1 Current Limitations
- No impact analysis when viewing elements
- Can't see ripple effects of element changes
- Missing social choreography visualization
- No economic balance overview
- Disconnected from journey flow

### 7.2 Journey Intelligence Enhancements
When selecting an element in unified view:
- Show complete timeline event revelation chain
- Visualize character access paths
- Calculate economic impact on all three paths
- Display social interaction requirements
- Highlight production dependencies

### 7.3 Data Already Available
- Timeline event IDs for story connections
- Character associations for access analysis
- Puzzle requirements for dependency mapping
- Memory values for economic calculations
- Container relationships for accessibility chains

## Summary

The Elements page is a **production-focused database view** that contains critical journey design data but presents it as isolated records rather than interconnected design intelligence. The page successfully tracks the physical production pipeline but fails to surface the complex web of dependencies that make elements crucial to journey design.

Key journey-relevant data (timeline connections, character access, puzzle dependencies, economic values) exists but requires mental mapping across multiple pages to understand impact. This makes it impossible to answer questions like "If I change this element's value, how does that affect player choice psychology?" without extensive cross-referencing.

The filtering system is robust for production tracking but doesn't support journey-based queries like "Show all elements that reveal Act 1 story beats" or "Which elements create Sarah-Derek collaboration opportunities."

**Verdict**: Contains essential journey data but lacks design decision support. Perfect candidate for entity-level intelligence transformation.
