## Common Patterns Across All Pages

### 1. Data Fetching Pattern
```javascript
const { data, isLoading, error, refetch } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['entityType', filters],
  queryFn: () => api.getEntityType(filters),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000
});
```

### 2. Filter State Management
- Server-side filters (passed to API)
- Client-side filters (applied to fetched data)
- Mix of controlled components (Select, Chip)
- Filter persistence (some in URL, some in state)

### 3. Analytics Hooks Pattern
```javascript
const analytics = useEntityAnalytics(data, gameConstants);
```

### 4. Common UI Components
- DataTable (sortable, searchable, clickable rows)
- PageHeader (title + actions)
- Dashboard cards (metrics visualization)
- Production alerts (issues display)
- Filter panels (various layouts)
- Error boundaries at multiple levels

### 5. Navigation Pattern
- Click table row → Navigate to detail page
- Consistent URL structure: `/entity-type/${id}`

## Key Features to Consolidate into Journey Intelligence

### 1. Universal Search & Filter System
- **Entity Type Toggle**: Character/Element/Puzzle/Timeline Event
- **Universal Filters**: Act Focus, Themes, Production Status
- **Entity-Specific Filters**: 
  - Characters: Type, Tier, Resolution Path
  - Elements: Memory Type, Memory Set, RFID Status
  - Puzzles: Narrative Thread, Reward Type
  - Timeline: Evidence Type, Character Involvement

### 2. Unified Analytics Dashboard
- **Production Readiness**: Across all entity types
- **Memory Economy Impact**: Token values and distribution
- **Social Choreography**: Character connections and dependencies
- **Story Completeness**: Timeline coverage and gaps

### 3. Enhanced Journey Graph
- **All Entity Types**: Characters + Elements + Puzzles + Timeline Events
- **Multi-Layer Visualization**:
  - Base journey structure
  - Memory economy overlay
  - Social dependency overlay
  - Production status overlay
  - Story revelation overlay

### 4. Context-Sensitive Intelligence Panel
When entity selected, show:
- **Impact Analysis**: What changes if this is modified
- **Dependency Map**: What depends on this entity
- **Integration Opportunities**: Where this could connect
- **Production Requirements**: Physical needs for this entity

### 5. Preserved Workflows
- **Quick Filters**: Keep the multi-select chip patterns
- **Bulk Selection**: For batch operations
- **Export Capabilities**: For production planning
- **Refresh Controls**: Manual data refresh
- **Search Within Results**: DataTable search functionality

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1 Features (Must Have)
1. Unified entity graph with all types
2. Basic filters (Act, Theme, Status)
3. Entity selection → Intelligence panel
4. Toggle between intelligence layers
5. Search across all entities

### Phase 2 Enhancements
1. Advanced filters (all entity-specific)
2. Saved filter sets
3. Batch operations
4. Export functionality
5. Customizable intelligence layers

### Phase 3 Integration
1. Real-time editing capabilities
2. Notion sync indicators
3. Collaborative features
4. Version history
5. Undo/redo support

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Current DataTables handle 100+ rows well
- JourneyGraphView handles 100+ nodes
- Need to maintain this performance with all entities

### State Management
- Zustand for UI state (selected entities, active layers)
- React Query for server state (all data fetching)
- URL state for shareable views

### Component Reuse
- DataTable component is highly reusable
- Filter components can be generalized
- Analytics hooks can be unified
- Dashboard cards can be templated

## Conclusion

The consolidation will preserve all critical features while eliminating:
- Page navigation overhead
- Context switching between views  
- Duplicate implementations (6 different ReactFlow instances)
- Inconsistent filter behaviors
- Separate analytics dashboards

The unified Journey Intelligence interface will provide:
- Single source of truth for all entities
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Comprehensive impact analysis
- Seamless workflow transitions
- Enhanced design decision support
