# Character Relationship Edges Implementation

## Overview
Implemented two missing relationship edge types in the JourneyIntelligenceView:
1. **Character-Element Association edges** (purple, dotted)
2. **Character-Timeline Event edges** (blue, animated)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Transformer Functions (dataTransformers.js)

Added two new edge creation functions:

#### createAssociationEdges
- Creates edges between characters and their associated elements
- Uses purple color (#a855f7) with dotted pattern (2,4)
- Validates both nodes exist before creating edge

#### createTimelineEdges  
- Creates edges between characters and timeline events
- Uses blue color (#3b82f6) with animation
- Solid line style to distinguish from other relationships

### 2. JourneyIntelligenceView Integration

Updated the view to:
1. Import the new edge creation functions
2. Process elements' `associated_character_ids` array to build association data
3. Process timeline events' `character_ids` array to build timeline relationships
4. Call the edge creation functions when progressive loading includes these entity types

### 3. Backend Data Structure

The backend already provides the necessary data:
- Elements include `associated_character_ids` array (from character_associated_elements table)
- Timeline events include `character_ids` array (from character_timeline_events table)

## Visual Design

### Edge Styles Summary
1. **Ownership** (green, dashed 5,5): Character owns Element
2. **Container** (gray, solid): Element contains Element  
3. **Puzzle Reward** (orange, dashed 3,3): Puzzle rewards Element
4. **Puzzle Requirement** (red, animated): Element required for Puzzle
5. **Association** (purple, dotted 2,4): Character associated with Element
6. **Timeline** (blue, animated solid): Character participates in Timeline Event

## Testing

Created test script `test-relationship-edges.js` that verifies:
- Backend provides the expected data structure
- Edge creation functions can process the data correctly
- Current data shows 141 Character-Timeline Event edges available

## Usage

The new edges are automatically created when:
1. Elements are loaded via progressive loading
2. Timeline events are loaded via progressive loading
3. Both source and target nodes exist in the graph

The edges follow the same validation pattern as other edge types, ensuring no invalid edges are created when nodes are filtered or aggregated.
