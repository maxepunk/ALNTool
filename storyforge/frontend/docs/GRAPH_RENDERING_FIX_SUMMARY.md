# Graph Rendering Fix Summary

## Issue
The ReactFlow graph canvas was rendering completely black despite having 22 nodes and 60 edges in the data.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Dark theme conflict**: Black nodes on black background (#0a0a0a)
2. **Node positioning**: Nodes initialized at (0,0) waiting for force layout
3. **Initial viewport**: Not fitting to content properly
4. **Color contrast**: Node borders and edges too dark for the background

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Background Color Fixes
- Added explicit background color to graph container (#0a0a0a)
- Added background color to ReactFlow renderer
- Made Background dots visible with color="#333"

### 2. Node Visibility Improvements
- Changed CharacterNode colors:
  - Background: #1a1a1a → #2d2d2d (lighter)
  - Border: #3b82f6 → #90caf9 (brighter blue)
  - Selected border: #1976d2 → #2196f3
  - Connected border: #42a5f5 → #64b5f6

### 3. Edge Visibility
- Changed default edge color from #64748b to #90caf9 (brighter)

### 4. Viewport & Layout Improvements
- Changed defaultViewport zoom from 0.8 to 0.5 (more zoomed out)
- Increased fitViewOptions padding from 0.1 to 0.2
- Added fallback fitView after 1 second timeout if layout not ready
- Added layout ready check for nodes with non-zero positions

### 5. Debug Additions
- Added node/edge count indicator in bottom-right corner
- Enhanced debug logging to show node positions and types
- Created debug scripts:
  - `/debug-graph-rendering.js` - Browser console debugging
  - `/test-graph-debug.html` - Interactive debug panel
  - `/test-minimal-graph.jsx` - Minimal test component
  - `/test-graph` route - Test route with simple graph

### 6. Container Styling
- Ensured parent containers have proper background colors
- Added ReactFlow-specific CSS overrides in JourneyIntelligenceView

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to the Journey Intelligence view
2. Check if you see:
   - Node/edge count indicator in bottom-right
   - Dot grid background
   - Controls in top-left
   - Debug panel showing graph data

3. To debug further:
   - Visit `/test-graph` route to see if basic ReactFlow works
   - Open browser console and run the debug script
   - Check browser DevTools for any CSS conflicts

## Next Steps if Still Not Visible
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ReactFlow CSS is loaded (check Network tab)
3. Use React DevTools to inspect node data
4. Try the test graph route to isolate the issue
5. Check if force simulation is running (should see position updates in console)
