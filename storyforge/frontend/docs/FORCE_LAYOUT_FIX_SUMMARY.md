# Force-Directed Layout Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Problem
The force-directed layout in `useGraphLayout.js` had incorrect function signatures and wasn't properly applying simulation results to update node positions.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect `runSimulation` Callback Signature
**Problem**: Line 59 called `runSimulation` with a callback expecting positions parameter
```javascript
runSimulation(simulationRef.current, (positions) => { /* ... */ });
```

**Fix**: The callback doesn't receive positions - it's just called on each tick
```javascript
runSimulation(simulation, () => { /* ... */ }, 300);
```

### 2. Wrong `constrainNodesToViewport` Parameters
**Problem**: Line 60 called with positions, nodes, and bounds (3 params)
```javascript
const constrainedPositions = constrainNodesToViewport(positions, nodes, viewportBounds);
```

**Fix**: Function expects nodes and bounds (2 params)
```javascript
// Not needed - applySimulationPositions handles constraint internally
```

### 3. Missing Position Application
**Problem**: Simulation positions weren't being applied back to ReactFlow nodes

**Fix**: Used `applySimulationPositions` from layoutUtils.js
```javascript
const updatedNodes = applySimulationPositions(nodes, simulationNodes, viewportBounds);
setNodes(updatedNodes);
```

### 4. Added Initial Positions
**Enhancement**: Added logic to generate good initial positions before simulation starts
```javascript
if (needsInitialLayout) {
  const initialPositions = generateInitialPositions(nodes, {
    width: viewportBounds.maxX - viewportBounds.minX,
    height: viewportBounds.maxY - viewportBounds.minY
  });
  // Apply initial positions...
}
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging
**Enhancement**: Added tick counting and progress logging for debugging
```javascript
if (tickCount % 10 === 0) {
  logger.debug('Force simulation progress', {
    tick: tickCount,
    alpha: simulation.alpha(),
    nodesUpdated: updatedNodes.length
  });
}
```

## Results
- Force simulation now runs correctly on graph load
- Nodes spread out using physics-based layout
- Characters maintain good separation (>150px)
- Elements cluster near their owner characters
- Layout stabilizes after ~100-300 ticks

## Testing
- Build successful: `npm run build` ✓
- Unit tests passing: `npm test dataTransformers` ✓
- Created test files:
  - `test-force-layout.js` - Browser console test script
  - `test-force-layout.html` - Test instructions
