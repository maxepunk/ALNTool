# Intelligence Layers Implementation Summary

## Overview
All 5 intelligence layers have been successfully connected to real backend data via React Query. The layers now display entity-specific analysis based on actual database content rather than mock data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Economic Layer (EconomicLayer.jsx)
**Data Sources:**
- `usePerformanceElements` hook for element memory values
- Real-time calculation of token portfolios and path pressure

**Features Implemented:**
- Element: Shows calculated memory value, memory group, multiplier, and choice pressure analysis
- Character: Calculates total token portfolio value and economic role
- Puzzle: Basic framework (needs puzzle economic data)

### 2. Story Intelligence Layer (StoryIntelligenceLayer.jsx)
**Data Sources:**
- `usePerformanceElements` hook for elements
- React Query fetch for timeline events (`/api/timeline`)

**Features Implemented:**
- Element: Timeline connections, narrative threads, story importance ratings
- Character: Counts owned elements, timeline connections, identifies narrative gaps
- Timeline Event: Shows revealing elements, story arc details, content balance analysis

### 3. Social Intelligence Layer (SocialIntelligenceLayer.jsx)
**Data Sources:**
- `usePerformanceElements` hook for elements
- React Query fetch for puzzles (`/api/puzzles`)

**Features Implemented:**
- Element: Shows ownership, puzzle requirements, collaboration patterns
- Character: Calculates collaboration load (direct + indirect), social resources
- Puzzle: Analyzes social complexity, required players, element dependencies

### 4. Production Intelligence Layer (ProductionIntelligenceLayer.jsx)
**Data Sources:**
- `usePerformanceElements` hook for elements
- React Query fetch for puzzles
- `elementFields` utilities for RFID/production status

**Features Implemented:**
- Element: RFID tracking status, production readiness, location/container info
- Character: Props inventory, RFID gaps on memory tokens, production blockers
- Puzzle: Element requirements check, production readiness assessment

### 5. Content Gaps Layer (ContentGapsLayer.jsx)
**Data Sources:**
- All three data sources (elements, timeline, puzzles)
- Cross-references to identify missing connections

**Features Implemented:**
- Element: Identifies missing timeline connections, narrative threads, orphaned status
- Character: Analyzes backstory completeness, element ownership, puzzle integration
- Timeline Event: Checks evidence distribution, identifies missing revealing elements

## Key Patterns Used

### 1. Consistent Data Fetching
```javascript
// All layers use same pattern
const { data: elements, isLoading: elementsLoading } = usePerformanceElements({
  includeMemoryTokens: true
});

const { data: timelineResponse, isLoading: timelineLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['timeline-events'],
  queryFn: () => api.getTimelineEvents(),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
});
```

### 2. Entity Type Detection
```javascript
// All layers check entityType first, then type
const entityCategory = selectedEntity.entityType || selectedEntity.type || 'unknown';
```

### 3. Real Data Analysis
- No more mock data - all analysis based on actual database content
- Graceful handling of missing data with appropriate warnings
- Progressive enhancement as more data becomes available

## Testing Results

Created `test-intelligence-layers.js` to verify data connections:
- ✅ Economic Layer: Successfully reads memory values from performance path
- ✅ Story Layer: Connects to timeline events API
- ✅ Social Layer: Fetches puzzle requirements and collaborations
- ✅ Production Layer: Checks RFID status and production readiness
- ✅ Content Gaps: Cross-references all data sources

## Current Data Limitations

The test revealed sparse data in the current database:
- Only 1 element has a calculated memory value
- No elements have timeline connections
- No elements have assigned owners
- No puzzles have requirements defined
- No RFID tags assigned

Despite sparse data, all layers are properly connected and will display rich analysis as more game content is added to the database.

## Usage

The layers automatically activate when:
1. A layer is toggled on in IntelligenceToggles
2. An entity is selected in the graph or entity selector
3. The IntelligenceManager properly checks the activeIntelligence array

Each layer provides contextual analysis specific to the selected entity type, helping game designers understand the impact and integration of their design decisions.
