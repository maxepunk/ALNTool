/**
 * Day 9 Validation Plan - Testing Design Intelligence with Real Data
 * 
 * What we built:
 * - Entity-level design decision support system
 * - 5 intelligence layers (Economic, Story, Social, Production, Content Gaps)
 * - Unified interface replacing 18 separate pages
 * 
 * What we're validating:
 * - Does our system answer the RIGHT questions for designers?
 * - Can users complete their design workflows?
 * - Does the UI perform well with actual data scale?

// CORE VALIDATION QUESTIONS

// 1. SARAH - Experience Designer
// "If I select Victoria, can I see her content gaps and integration opportunities?"
// "When I look at Victoria's voice memo element, do I understand its impact?"
const sarahValidation = {
  workflow: "Character Development Intelligence",
  steps: [
    "Select Victoria character",
    "View content gap analysis",
    "Identify missing timeline events",
    "Select Victoria's voice memo element", 
    "See economic impact ($5000 value)",
    "Understand which characters can discover it",
    "See production requirements"
  ],
  success: "Can identify what content to create and where to integrate it"
};

// 2. MARCUS - Puzzle Designer  
// "If I select Sarah's jewelry box puzzle, can I see the social choreography?"
// "Do I understand how changing rewards affects economic balance?"
const marcusValidation = {
  workflow: "Puzzle Dependency Analysis",
  steps: [
    "Select jewelry box puzzle",
    "View required collaborations (Alex + Derek)",
    "See reward values and economic impact",
    "Understand downstream puzzle effects",
    "Check character access patterns",
    "Verify production dependencies"
  ],
  success: "Can design puzzles that create meaningful social interactions"
};

// 3. ALEX - Production Coordinator
// "Can I see all props needed for Derek's journey?"
// "What breaks if we're missing Derek's business card?"
const alexValidation = {
  workflow: "Production Requirement Tracking", 
  steps: [
    "Select Derek character",
    "View all required props",
    "See puzzle dependencies",
    "Identify critical path items",
    "Check RFID status",
    "Understand cascade failures"
  ],
  success: "Can track all physical requirements and dependencies"
};

// 4. JAMIE - Content Creator
// "Which characters have content gaps?"
// "Where can I integrate new Howie content?"
const jamieValidation = {
  workflow: "Content Gap Identification",
  steps: [
    "View overview with content gaps layer",
    "Identify underwritten characters",
    "Select Howie (minimal content)",
    "See integration opportunities", 
    "Understand social capacity",
    "Plan timeline events"
  ],
  success: "Can identify gaps and plan content integration"
};

// TECHNICAL VALIDATION

const technicalChecks = {
  performance: {
    initialLoad: "< 2 seconds",
    entitySelection: "< 500ms response", 
    layerToggle: "< 200ms render",
    aggregation: "Triggers at 50 nodes"
  },
  
  dataIntegrity: {
    dualPathHandling: "Both 'type' and 'basicType' fields work",
    elementCount: "~100 elements, ~7 memory tokens",
    characterCount: "22 characters",
    journeyNodes: "~23 nodes per character journey"
  },
  
  intelligence: {
    economicCalculations: "Memory token values computed correctly",
    socialMapping: "Collaboration requirements accurate",
    storyConnections: "Timeline event associations work",
    productionTracking: "RFID and prop status current"
  }
