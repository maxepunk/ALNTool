## 🚀 Post-Debt Development Plan

Once all Priority 1 and 2 tasks are complete, we will resume our feature development roadmap.

### 🔧 Journey Engine: The Narrative Graph

### Core Concept Evolution
Our most critical architectural insight was realizing that a player's journey is not a linear timeline, but a **causal graph of dependencies**. The `journeyEngine` has been completely refactored around this principle.

### `buildJourneyGraph(characterId)`
This is the new core function. It constructs a directed graph representing the "blow-by-blow" narrative path for a character.

**Multi-Pass Implementation:**
1.  **Pass 1: Node Collection**: Gathers all relevant entities (puzzles, elements, events) for a character using the new `getCharacterJourneyData` query. Each entity becomes a typed node (`activityNode`, `discoveryNode`, `loreNode`).
2.  **Pass 2: Gameplay Graph (Dependency Edges)**: Creates "hard" dependency edges between gameplay nodes. For example: `Element (Key) -> Puzzle (Unlock Chest) -> Element (Reward)`.
3.  **Pass 3: Lore Weaving (Context Edges)**: Connects `Discovery` nodes from the Gameplay Graph to `Event` nodes in the Lore Graph, showing the narrative reason for a discovery.
4.  **Pass 4: Interaction Mapping (Pending)**: Will identify and create edges representing interactions between different character journeys.

### 🖥️ Frontend: Graph Visualization

The frontend has been refactored to consume and display the new narrative graph data structure.

### `JourneyGraphView.jsx`
- This new component replaces the old `TimelineView`.
- It uses `@xyflow/react` to render the nodes and edges provided by the `/api/journeys/:characterId` endpoint.

### `useAutoLayout.js` Hook
- A new custom hook that uses the `dagre` library to automatically calculate node positions.
- It takes the raw nodes and edges and returns a set of nodes with `x` and `y` coordinates, ensuring a clean, hierarchical layout.

### Custom Node Components
- Located in `storyforge/frontend/src/components/PlayerJourney/customNodes/`.
- We have created distinct components for each node type to provide visual clarity:
    - `ActivityNode` (for puzzles)
    - `DiscoveryNode` (for elements)
    - `LoreNode` (for historical events)

### `ContextWorkspace.jsx`
- This component has been refactored to be node-aware.
- It subscribes to the `selectedNode` state in the `journeyStore`.
- When a user clicks a node in the graph, this component updates to display its details.

## 🧮 Computed Fields Implementation Guide

### Overview
Several critical fields don't exist in Notion but must be computed from relationships. These are NOT optional - core PRD features depend on them.

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-06-07)

#### Act Focus (Timeline Events) - WORKING!
- Computed for all 75 timeline events
- Based on most common act from related elements
- Enables timeline filtering by act

#### Resolution Paths (All Entities) - WORKING!
- Computed for 22 characters, 100 elements, 15 puzzles
- Based on ownership patterns and game logic
- Enables Balance Dashboard and Resolution Path Analyzer

#### Linked Characters - WORKING!
- Query implemented and added to journey API
- Returns character relationships from character_links table
- Enables Character Sociogram visualization

#### Narrative Threads (Puzzles) - WORKING!
- **UNBLOCKED**: The database migration now runs correctly, so the `narrative_threads` and `computed_narrative_threads` columns exist and are populated during the sync.

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

#### Path Affinity Scores
- Need to extract memory values from descriptions
- Calculate alignment scores for each path

#### Memory Value Totals
- Parse SF_ValueRating from element descriptions
- Aggregate per character

#### Interaction Density
- Count interactions per time segment
- Flag low-interaction segments

**Implementation Priority:**
1. 🔴 Linked Characters (Frontend blocked)
2. 🟡 Puzzle sync fixes (Data integrity)
3. 🟡 Missing field storage (Data completeness)
4. 🟢 Analytics computation (Enhancement)

## 🔧 Critical Architecture: Computed Fields

### Overview
The Production Intelligence Tool relies on computed fields that transform raw Notion data into actionable insights. These fields are essential for core features like the Balance Dashboard and Resolution Path Analyzer.

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Notion**: Source of truth for raw data
2. **SQLite**: Local cache with computed fields
3. **Frontend**: Always uses SQLite data via backend API

### Essential Computed Fields
1. **Act Focus**
   - Computed for timeline events
   - Aggregates from related elements
   - Used for timeline filtering and balance analysis

2. **Resolution Paths**
   - Computed for all entities (characters, puzzles, elements)
   - Based on ownership patterns and game logic
   - Critical for Balance Dashboard (Phase 3 PRD requirement)
   - Calculation rules:
     - Black Market path = owns memory tokens or black market cards
     - Detective path = has evidence or investigation tools
     - Third Path = high community connections

3. **Narrative Threads**
   - Rollup from rewards
   - Used for story coherence analysis
   - Essential for Timeline Archaeology feature

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Notion Validation Protocol</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

### 🎯 Notion Validation Protocol
**🚨 NEW PROCESS (June 14, 2025)**: Before assuming data issues are technical bugs, validate against Notion first.

#### When to Use Notion Validation
- Missing or NULL computed fields (act_focus, narrative_threads, resolution_paths)
- Unexpected data gaps or patterns  
- Sync appears successful but data seems incomplete
- Documentation claims differ from database reality

#### Validation Steps
1. **Check Field Existence in Notion**
   ```javascript
   // Use MCP Notion tools to query the database
   // Example: Check if Act Focus exists in Timeline database
   await mcp_notion_query_database({
     database_id: "1b52f33d583f80deae5ad20c120dd", // Timeline
     page_size: 5
   });
   ```

2. **Understand Data Dependencies**
   ```javascript
   // Check if computed field dependencies exist
   // Example: Act Focus depends on Elements having "First Available"
   await mcp_notion_query_database({
     database_id: "18c2f33d583f802091bcd84c7dd94306", // Elements
     filter: {
       property: "First Available",
       select: { is_not_empty: true }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Distinguish Bug vs Data Gap**
   - **Data Gap**: Field missing in Notion → NULL values expected
   - **Technical Bug**: Field exists in Notion but not syncing → Code issue
   - **Design Issue**: Field doesn't exist in Notion → Need computed field

#### Example: Act Focus Analysis
```
Problem: 42/75 timeline events missing act_focus
Notion Check: Act Focus field doesn't exist in Timeline database  
Dependency Check: 59/100 elements missing "First Available" field
Conclusion: Data incompleteness, NOT technical bug
Solution: Document as expected behavior, add data quality reporting
```

<summary>🐛 <strong>Common Sync Issues</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

### Common Sync Issues
1. **Foreign Key Violations**
   - **Symptom**: "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed"
   - **Cause**: Relationship sync before entity sync
   - **Fix**: Ensure two-phase sync (entities → relationships)
   - **Prevention**: Use transaction rollback

2. **Missing Computed Fields**
   - **Symptom**: "Property not found in Notion object"
   - **Cause**: Trying to extract computed field from Notion
   - **Fix**: Use SQLite data instead of Notion API
   - **Prevention**: Update frontend to use backend API

3. **Puzzle Sync Failures**
   - **Symptom**: 17/32 puzzles fail to sync
   - **Cause**: Missing required fields in Notion
   - **Fix**: Debug specific Notion entries
   - **Workaround**: App works with partial data

4. **Migration Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Computed fields columns missing
   - **Cause**: Migration not auto-applying
   - **Fix**: Manual application via sqlite3
   - **Prevention**: Add migration verification

</details>

<summary>🔨 <strong>Debugging Tools</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

### Debugging Tools
1. **Sync Logging**
   ```javascript
   // Enable detailed logging
   process.env.SYNC_DEBUG = 'true';
   ```

2. **Database Inspection**
   ```sql
   -- Check computed fields
   SELECT id, name, resolution_paths FROM characters;
   SELECT id, name, act_focus FROM timeline_events;
   ```

3. **Notion Data Verification**
   ```javascript
   // Log raw Notion data
   console.log('Raw Notion data:', await notionService.getCharacters());
   ```

## 🚨 Final Mile: Connecting Phase 4+ Features to Users

### Critical Context (Updated June 15, 2025 - VERIFIED)
The tool has sophisticated features already built but inaccessible due to:
1. ~~Data pipeline gaps~~ ✅ Fixed - pipeline working correctly
2. Frontend design failures (still need to surface features)
3. Data quality issues in Notion (designer responsibility)

### Data Pipeline Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

#### 0. ~~Character Links Schema Fix~~ ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
**Finding**: Character links are already working correctly with 60 relationships.
The schema uses `character_a_id` and `character_b_id` as expected.
No fix needed - audit was incorrect.

#### 1. ~~Memory Value Extraction~~ ✅ ALREADY INTEGRATED
**Finding**: MemoryValueExtractor is already integrated in ComputeOrchestrator.
- Extractor runs during compute pipeline
- Database cleanup completed: removed deprecated `memory_value` column
- Using only `calculated_memory_value` for consistency

**Verified Data Issue (June 15, 2025)**: 
- Only 1/100 elements has non-zero memory value (Howie's Memory Token = 200)
- SF_ references found in description text (e.g., "S.F. - Last Try - 23:45")
- Template format exists in some descriptions but not parsed as structured data
- **Action Required**: Designer must add proper memory values to 99 elements in Notion

#### 2. Act Focus Computation - DATA QUALITY ISSUE, NOT BUG
- **Finding**: 42 timeline_events missing act_focus due to incomplete Notion data
- **Root Cause**: 59/100 elements missing "First Available" field in Notion Elements database
- **Technical Status**: ActFocusComputer is working correctly
- **Action Required**: Game designers must populate "First Available" in Elements
- **Tool Behavior**: Correctly returns NULL act_focus when source data incomplete
- **This is expected behavior** - the tool helps identify data gaps for designers

### Frontend Design Fixes Required

#### 3. Surface Hidden Features in Navigation
```javascript
// File: src/layouts/AppLayout.jsx
// Add prominent section:
{
  title: "Production Intelligence",
  icon: <AssessmentIcon />,
  items: [
    { name: "Experience Flow Analysis", path: "/player-journey", 
      description: "Pacing & bottleneck detection" },
    { name: "Memory Economy Workshop", path: "/memory-economy",
      description: "Token tracking & balance" },
    { name: "Character Sociogram", path: "/character-sociogram",
      description: "Relationship visualization" }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Default to Production Mode
```javascript
// File: src/pages/MemoryEconomyPage.jsx, Line 66
const [workshopMode, setWorkshopMode] = useState(true); // was false
```

#### 5. Add Discovery Mechanisms
- Add info tooltips explaining advanced features
- Create "Production Mode" toggle in header
- Add onboarding flow highlighting analysis tools
- Include feature cards on dashboard

### Features That Already Exist (DO NOT REBUILD)
- **ExperienceFlowAnalyzer** - Pacing analysis, bottleneck detection
- **MemoryEconomyWorkshop** - 55-token economy tracking
- **DualLensLayout** - Side-by-side journey and system views

### How to Verify Success
**Data Pipeline:**
- Memory values populate in economy view when SF_ templates are complete
- Timeline events show act assignments when Elements have "First Available" populated
- **Note**: NULL act_focus values are expected until Notion data is complete

**Frontend Design:**
- Production Intelligence prominent in navigation
- Workshop mode shows by default
- Analysis features have clear CTAs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "I don't know what I'm supposed to be building"
1. Check Current Task section above
2. Find your milestone in this playbook
3. Read the Acceptance Criteria
4. Look at the PRD mockups for visual reference

#### "The existing code doesn't match what I'm supposed to build"
This is expected! StoryForge is entity-centric, we're making it journey-centric.
- Keep existing code working (feature flags)
- Build new features alongside
- Only modify existing code when necessary
- Document what you're changing and why

#### "I'm getting 404 errors on journey endpoints"
**Root Cause**: SQLite database is empty
```bash
cd storyforge/backend
node scripts/sync-data.js
# Verify with: node scripts/sync-data.js --status
```

#### "Character sync shows foreign key constraint errors"
This has been fixed with two-phase sync. If you still see this:
- Pull latest code changes
- Check dataSyncService.js has `syncCharacterRelationships()` method
- Ensure sync runs in correct order

#### "Puzzle sync is failing with errors"
**Known Issue**: 17 out of 32 puzzles fail to sync (Notion data issue)
- The app works with partial puzzle data
- Missing puzzles won't break journey computation
- Debug specific puzzles by logging raw Notion data

#### "Database shows 0 records after sync"
```bash
# Run a fresh sync
cd storyforge/backend
node scripts/sync-data.js

# Verify all data synced
node scripts/sync-data.js --status
# Should show:
# characters: 22 records
# elements: 100 records
# puzzles: 15 records (17 fail)
# timeline_events: 75 records
# character_links: 125 records
```

#### "Computed fields are null"
These must be computed after base data sync:
- ✅ Act Focus - Computed for timeline events
- ✅ Resolution Paths - Computed for all entities
- ✅ Narrative Threads - Computed for puzzles

If still null:
1. Ensure full sync completed
2. Check sync output for "Computing derived fields..."
3. Verify computation completed

#### "Timeline events missing act_focus values"
**This is NOT a bug** - it's expected behavior when Notion data is incomplete.

**Root Cause**: Elements missing "First Available" field in Notion
- **Current Status**: 59/100 elements missing "First Available" 
- **Result**: 42/75 timeline events have NULL act_focus
- **Technical Status**: ActFocusComputer works correctly

**Verification Steps**:
```bash
# Check element data quality
cd storyforge/backend
node -e "
const db = require('./src/db/database').getDB();
const stats = db.prepare('SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(first_available) as has_act FROM elements').get();
console.log('Elements:', stats.total, 'with act:', stats.has_act);
"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Tool correctly returns NULL when source data incomplete
- This helps game designers identify data gaps
- Act focus will populate as designers complete "First Available" in Elements

**Action Required**: Game designers must populate "First Available" field in Notion Elements database.

#### "Memory token values aren't being extracted"
Format in Notion Elements:
```
Description: "A memory of the first rave... 
SF_RFID: 12345
SF_ValueRating: 3
SF_MemoryType: Personal"
```

Extraction should happen:
1. During sync (extract and store in separate column)
2. During journey computation (aggregate per character)
3. During path affinity calculation (sum values)

#### "I don't understand the journey computation logic"
**Journey = Character's 90-minute experience**

Key Concepts:
- **Segments**: 5-minute time blocks (18 total)
- **Activities**: What they do (find item, solve puzzle)
- **Interactions**: Who they meet
- **Discoveries**: What they learn
- **Gaps**: Segments with no content

Visual:
```
0-5 min:   [Activities] [Interactions] [Discoveries]
5-10 min:  [Activities] [----GAP----] [Discoveries]
10-15 min: [Activities] [Interactions] [Discoveries]
```

#### "The gap detection seems arbitrary"
**Gap Rules** (from game design):
- **Dead time**: >10 minutes with no activity
- **Isolation**: >15 minutes with no interactions
- **No progress**: No discoveries for >20 minutes
- **Bottlenecks**: Required items not available

```javascript
// Gaps are not just empty time - they're problematic patterns
if (noActivitiesFor(10) || noInteractionsFor(15)) {
  createGap('high_severity');
}
```

#### "State management is confusing"
**Three Layers**:
1. **UI State** (Zustand): What view, what's selected
2. **Data State** (SQLite + React Query): Journeys, gaps
3. **Sync State**: What needs to sync with Notion

Data Flow:
```
Notion → SQLite → React Query → Zustand → Components
         ↑__________________________|
                  (Updates)
```

#### "Performance is terrible"
Common Culprits:
1. **Rendering all journeys at once** - Use virtual scrolling
2. **Re-computing on every render** - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
3. **Too many API calls** - Batch requests, use React Query caching

Performance Checklist:
- [ ] React DevTools Profiler shows <16ms renders
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] API calls are batched/cached
- [ ] Large lists use virtualization

#### "I don't understand the three resolution paths"
Quick Reference:
- **Black Market**: Accumulate wealth through memory trading
- **Detective**: Pursue truth and justice through evidence
- **Third Path**: Community-focused memory recovery

For Complete Understanding: See [active_synthesis_streamlined.md](./docs/archive/design/game design background/active_synthesis_streamlined.md) Section III.B

Path Assignment Logic - Characters align based on:
- Element ownership (e.g., Black Market card)
- Actions taken (investigating = Detective)
- Community connections (high connections = Third Path)

#### "What's the memory economy?"
**Memory Token System**:
- Physical RFID tokens worth $100-$10,000
- Type multipliers: Personal ×1, Business ×3, Technical ×5
- Only 3 scanners for 5-20 players (creates scarcity)

Complete Details: See [active_synthesis_streamlined.md](./docs/archive/design/game design background/active_synthesis_streamlined.md) Section III

For Implementation:
- Values embedded in Element descriptions as `SF_ValueRating: [1-5]`
- Must extract during sync and calculate totals

#### "Narrative threads computation fails with 'no such column'"
**UPDATE (2025-06-10)**: This has been FIXED!
The migration system has been enhanced with verification and auto-fix capabilities.

If you still see this error:
```bash
# The migration should auto-apply, but if needed:
cd storyforge/backend
sqlite3 data/production.db < src/db/migration-scripts/20250106000000_add_computed_fields.sql
```

#### Recovery Strategies
When completely lost:
1. Git stash your changes
2. Go back to last working commit
3. Re-read the milestone in this playbook
4. Start with smallest possible implementation
5. Build incrementally

### Red Flags You're Off Track
1. Building features not in current milestone
2. Modifying core StoryForge functionality
3. Creating new database schemas not in PRD
4. Implementing complex UI before basic works
5. Working on optimization before functionality

**Remember**: Make it work → Make it right → Make it fast

## 📊 Technical Debt Repayment History

### Completed Technical Debt Tasks

#### P.DEBT.1.1: Sanitize `db/queries.js` ✅
**Completed**: June 6, 2025

Removed 7 deprecated functions from legacy timeline/gap model:
- `getEventsForCharacter`, `getPuzzlesForCharacter`, `getElementsForCharacter`
- `getCachedJourney`, `saveCachedJourney`, `isValidJourneyCache`
- `updateGapResolution`

**Impact**: Eliminated risk of using obsolete code, improved clarity

#### P.DEBT.1.2: Decommission Legacy Database Tables ✅
**Completed**: June 6, 2025

Dropped 4 obsolete tables via migration:
- `journey_segments`, `gaps`
- `cached_journey_segments`, `cached_journey_gaps`

**Impact**: Cleaner database schema aligned with graph model

#### P.DEBT.1.3: Remove Zombie Logic ✅
**Completed**: June 6, 2025

Removed obsolete methods from `journeyEngine.js`:

## 🎮 Game Design Context

> **Summary**: Complete understanding of "About Last Night" - a 90-minute immersive murder mystery with memory token economy, three resolution paths, and themes critiquing surveillance capitalism. Essential for understanding why certain features exist, how the memory economy works, and the relationship between physical puzzles and digital tracking. Includes detailed character paths, puzzle mechanics, and production considerations.

### Complete Game Understanding
"About Last Night" is a 90-minute immersive murder mystery experience for 5-20 players that critiques surveillance capitalism through innovative gameplay mechanics.

#### Game Structure
- **Act 1 (45-60 minutes)**: Investigation phase
  - Players have amnesia, discover identity through belongings
  - Physical evidence gathering from party aftermath
  - Collaborative puzzle-solving to unlock containers
  - Dual investigation: "What happened to Marcus?" and "Who am I?"
  - Critical discovery: James's video reveals Marcus entering Room 2 at 4:36 AM

- **Act 2 (45-60 minutes)**: Memory economy phase
  - RFID-based memory token trading system
  - Access to Marcus's secret lab after viewing video
  - Three distinct resolution paths emerge
  - 3 handheld scanners create scarcity and negotiation
  - Time pressure drives trading dynamics

#### Core Game Architecture
**Three Resolution Paths**:
1. **Black Market (Wealth)**: Sell memories for profit, highest total wins
2. **Detective (Truth)**: Submit memories as evidence, build comprehensive case
3. **Third Path (Community)**: Return memories to POV owners, reject authorities

**Character System**:
- **Tier 1 (Core 5)**: Primary suspects, always assigned
- **Tier 2 (Secondary)**: Rich experiences, assigned at 6+ players  
- **Tier 3 (Tertiary)**: Lighter content, assigned at 13+ players
- **Balancing**: Lower-tier characters get MORE memory tokens to compensate

**Memory Token Economy**:
- Base Values: $100 / $500 / $1,000 / $5,000 / $10,000
- Type Multipliers: Personal ×1, Business ×3, Technical ×5
- Group Bonuses: Complete sets multiply total value
- **Target**: 50-55 total tokens (currently 13 documented)

#### Database Architecture (Designer Tools)
Four Notion databases structure the game design:
1. **Characters**: Maps complete player journeys from amnesia to understanding
2. **Elements**: All physical and digital items with relationships
3. **Puzzles**: Orchestrates social dynamics through dependencies
4. **Timeline**: 19-year hidden history (2006-2025) generating evidence

**Data Flow**: Timeline Event → Evidence Element → Puzzle Lock → Discovery → Memory Token → Understanding

#### Physical Space Design
- **Room 1**: Act 1 investigation hub
- **Room 2**: Marcus's secret lab (Act 2 revelation)
- **Detective Room**: Glass-windowed trap for Detective during Act 2
- **3 ESP32 scanners** with RFID create meaningful scarcity

#### Information Revelation Design
**Starting State**: Players have only:
- Basic identity (name, profession)
- 3-5 personal items
- No memories of relationships, events, or party

**Discovery Vectors**:
- Physical evidence and props
- Environmental storytelling  
- Memory tokens (audio/video)
- Other players' findings

**Hidden Timeline**: The 19-year history exists only for designers. Players learn events only through discovered evidence. Many events may never be found, creating a world larger than any single playthrough.

#### Critical Puzzle Chains
**UV Light Chain**: Sarah → UV Light → Alex (with Victoria's hint)
**One Pagers Chain**: Victoria → Documents → James
**Birthday Collection**: Ashe gathers info from 5 players

**Minimum Viable Flow**:
```
Victoria (solo) → James (needs Victoria) → 2nd Room Video
Sarah (solo) → UV Light → Alex (needs Sarah)  
Derek (hint from Sarah) → Black Market Card
All converge → Murder Wall → Memory Reader → Act 2
```

#### Design Philosophy
- **Emergence Over Prescription**: Third Path discovered through play
- **Physical-Digital Integration**: RFID tokens make abstract memories tangible
- **Thematic Reinforcement**: Every mechanic reflects surveillance capitalism
- **Intentional Flexibility**: Edge cases handled through human judgment
- **Trust Over Algorithm**: Human implementation over rigid prescription

### Implementation Guidelines for Tool Development

#### When Building Character Features
- Support all 3 tiers with appropriate content distribution
- Lower tiers should have MORE token allocation options
- Character relationships are critical for puzzle dependencies
- 5-20 player scalability must be maintained

#### When Building Puzzle Features  
- Support 3 complexity levels: Simple (1-2min), Complex (5-10min), Collaborative (10-15min)
- Puzzle chains create social dependencies
- Critical path must remain functional with minimal completion
- Tool should help designers identify puzzle bottlenecks

#### When Building Memory Economy Features
- Support value structure: $100-$10,000 with type multipliers
- Group completion bonuses are essential for balance
- Track 3 resolution paths with different victory conditions
- Physical turn-in simulation for testing

#### When Building Timeline Features
- 19-year history drives all evidence generation
- Timeline events should link to discoverable elements
- Support archaeological discovery patterns
- Many events intentionally never discovered

#### Performance Targets for Game Data
- **Characters**: 20+ with full relationship mapping
- **Elements**: 100+ physical and digital items
- **Puzzles**: 30+ with dependency chains
- **Timeline Events**: 75+ spanning 19 years
- **Memory Tokens**: 50-55 total (target completion)

### Common Game Design Questions

#### "How much content should players discover?"
- Timeline: ~30-50% typical discovery rate
- Puzzles: Minimum viable path must work, extras enhance
- Memory tokens: All should be discoverable but not required

#### "How do I balance the three paths?"
- Black Market: Highest monetary total (relative victory)
- Detective: Subjective case quality (30/25/25/20 rubric)
- Third Path: Return memories + reject authorities (trust-based)

#### "What creates optimal trading dynamics?"
- 3 scanners for 5-20 players creates scarcity
- Time pressure escalates negotiations
- Information asymmetry drives strategy
- Alliance tracking only for Black Market

#### "How should the tool help with accessibility?"
- Support alternative interaction methods
- Provide clear content warnings
- Enable facilitator customization
- Document accessibility considerations

## 🏗️ Production Planning Context

### Tool Purpose Clarification
This tool is designed for **game content creation and balance analysis**, NOT for running live game productions. It serves designers, writers, and production planners during the development phase.

#### What the Tool Does
- **Content Design**: Create and balance game elements (characters, puzzles, memory tokens)
- **Journey Planning**: Map player paths and interactions
- **Balance Analysis**: Monitor three-path equilibrium
- **Production Preparation**: Generate specifications and requirements

#### What the Tool Does NOT Do
- **Live Game Management**: Not for real-time production control
- **RFID Hardware**: Does not interface with physical scanners
- **Player Tracking**: Does not monitor actual players during games
- **Real-Time Decisions**: Not for live facilitation support

### Production Planning Features

#### Physical Space Planning Support
The tool provides digital planning for physical implementation:

**Room Layout Context**:
- **Room 1**: Act 1 investigation hub
- **Room 2**: Marcus's secret lab (revealed in Act 2)
- **Detective Room**: Glass-windowed space for Detective during Act 2
- **Support Areas**: Facilitator staging and equipment storage

**Hardware Planning**:
- **3 ESP32 scanners** with RFID readers
- **50-55 memory tokens** with RFID tags
- **Physical props** and environmental storytelling elements
- **Safety considerations** for multi-room setup

#### Production Documentation Generation
The tool should help generate:

**Setup Documentation**:
- Token inventory checklists
- Room setup diagrams
- Props placement guides
- Equipment requirements lists

**Facilitator Materials**:
- Character briefing sheets
- Puzzle solution guides
- Memory token value references
- Emergency procedures

**Training Resources**:
- Black Market operation procedures
- Detective evaluation rubrics
- Third Path recognition guidelines
- Edge case handling protocols

#### Missing Production Features (Enhancement Opportunities)
Current gaps that could enhance production planning:

1. **Physical Layout Designer**: Visual room arrangement tool
2. **Device Allocation Simulator**: Plan scanner placement and queuing
3. **Setup Timeline Planner**: Sequence setup and teardown tasks
4. **Safety Checklist Generator**: Multi-room safety protocols
5. **Facilitator Script Builder**: Step-by-step operation guides
6. **Hardware Requirements Calculator**: Equipment needs by group size
7. **Accessibility Adaptation Planner**: Alternative interaction methods

### Implementation Guidelines

#### When Building Production Features
- Focus on planning and specification generation
- Support export to production-friendly formats
- Provide clear separation between design and execution
- Enable customization for different venue constraints

#### Production Planning Data Model
The tool tracks production-relevant information:

**Venue Requirements**:
- Room count and configuration
- Equipment placement needs
- Safety considerations
- Accessibility requirements

**Resource Planning**:
- Token distribution by character tier
- Scanner placement optimization
- Facilitator role assignments
- Time allocation for phases

**Documentation Export**:
- Setup checklists and procedures
- Character briefing materials
- Puzzle reference guides
- Safety and emergency protocols

### Common Production Questions

#### "How do I plan physical token distribution?"
- Use Memory Economy tools to balance token allocation
- Export token lists with values and character assignments
- Plan distribution based on character tier balance

#### "What hardware do I need for X players?"
- 3 scanners optimal for 5-20 players (creates scarcity)
- One facilitator minimum, two preferred
- Room capacity determines maximum players
- RFID equipment scales with token count

#### "How do I train facilitators?"
- Export character interaction maps
- Generate puzzle solution references
- Create path evaluation rubrics
- Document edge case handling procedures

#### "What about accessibility accommodations?"
- Alternative token interaction methods
- Visual/auditory puzzle adaptations
- Physical space modifications
- Communication alternatives

For complete production requirements, coordinate with physical venue and equipment teams.

## 🚀 Documentation Automation System

### Overview
This project features a **fully automated documentation system** that eliminates manual documentation updates and ensures consistency across all files.

### Core Infrastructure
- **TaskStatusManager**: Central hub for all documentation automation
- **Template Markers**: Automatic update points in documentation files
- **NPM Scripts**: Simple commands for documentation management
- **Verification Integration**: Documentation consistency checks in `npm run verify:all`

### Available Commands
```bash
# Daily workflow
npm run docs:status-report        # Check current status
npm run docs:task-complete P.DEBT.3.10  # Complete task & update ALL docs

# Verification 
npm run docs:verify-sync          # Check documentation consistency
npm run docs:test                 # Test automation system
npm run verify:all               # Full verification (includes docs)

# One-time setup
npm run docs:init                 # Initialize automation (already done)
```

### Streamlined Workflow
**Old Workflow** (Manual, Error-Prone):
1. Complete implementation work
2. Manually update multiple documentation files
3. Hope everything stays consistent

**New Workflow** (Automated, Reliable):
1. Complete implementation work
2. Run: `npm run docs:task-complete <task-id>`
3. **Everything updates automatically!**

### Benefits
- ✅ **Zero manual documentation updates required**
- ✅ **Consistent status across all files**
- ✅ **Real-time progress tracking**
- ✅ **Automatic verification integration**
- ✅ **Developer-friendly workflow**

### Technical Details
**Template Markers**:
```markdown
<!-- AUTO:CURRENT_TASK -->P.DEBT.3.10 – Fix Puzzle Sync (NEXT)<!-- /AUTO:CURRENT_TASK -->
<!-- AUTO:PROGRESS -->10/11<!-- /AUTO:PROGRESS -->
<!-- AUTO:LAST_COMPLETED -->P.DEBT.3.9 (June 10, 2025)<!-- /AUTO:LAST_COMPLETED -->
```

**Integration Points**:
- **TodoWrite**: Task progress tracking
- **Verification System**: Consistency checks
- **NPM Scripts**: Simple command interface
- **CLAUDE.md**: Streamlined workflow guide

**Result**: Future developers can focus entirely on implementation while documentation stays perfectly synchronized and up-to-date automatically.

## 📊 Documentation Authority System

### Overview
When documentation conflicts arise or questions about authority emerge, consult the [AUTHORITY_MATRIX.md](./AUTHORITY_MATRIX.md) for definitive guidance. This system prevents the confusion that previously plagued the project.

### Quick Reference: 6-Tier Hierarchy
1. **Code & Database** (Ultimate truth - what the system actually does)
2. **PRD & Notion** (Strategic direction - what we're building toward)  
3. **README & PLAYBOOK** (Operational guides - current work)
4. **Migrations & Tests** (Technical specs - how it's built)
5. **Archives & History** (Context - why decisions were made)
6. **CLAUDE & Guides** (Onboarding - how to get started)

### Training Resources
For comprehensive understanding of our documentation system:
- **[Developer Quick Start Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_QUICK_START.md)** - Quick onboarding and common scenarios
- **[Claude Code Guide](./docs/CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md)** - Claude Code best practices
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md)** - Common issues and solutions

### Key Principle
**"When documentation and implementation disagree, implementation is correct. Update the docs, not the code."**

### Common Authority Questions

**Q: "The schema guide says one thing but the database shows another"**
- A: Database (Tier 1) wins. Update the schema guide.

**Q: "README says Phase 1 but I see Phase 4 features"**  
- A: Code (Tier 1) wins. README needs updating.

**Q: "PRD requires X but implementation does Y"**
- A: Implementation (Tier 1) reflects reality. Document the gap.

**Q: "Which document should I update when I change code?"**
- A: Check [AUTHORITY_MATRIX.md](./AUTHORITY_MATRIX.md) → Update Triggers section
