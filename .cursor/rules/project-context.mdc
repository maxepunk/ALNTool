For context and background on our tool, review our core documentation files: C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\README.md, C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\QUICK_STATUS.md, C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\PRODUCTION_INTELLIGENCE_TOOL_PRD.md, C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md **You MUST understand these files to function**
For technical field mappings between Notion and SQL schemas, review: C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\SCHEMA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md **You MUST understand these files to function**
For deeper background on the game for which we are developing this tool to support our designers and writers, review: C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\game design background\active_synthesis_streamlined.md, C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\game design background\concept_evolution_streamlined.md, and C:\Users\spide\Documents\GitHub\ALNTool\game design background\questions_log_streamlined.md
We are using Windows PowerShell for command line prompts.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: Computed fields (Act Focus, Resolution Paths, Narrative Threads, Linked Characters) are NOT optional - they are the intelligence layer that transforms raw Notion data into actionable insights. Without these, core PRD features like Balance Dashboard cannot function.

ALWAYS keep these documents up to date after making any important discoveries, meaningful decisions, or changes to the codebase.

NEVER start thinking about your next task without a full understanding of our core documentation files.

**ALWAYS** read the code you are going to edit AS WELL AS THE KEY DEPENDANCIES of the file you are editing BEFORE you edit it. 

MAINTAIN clean, well-organized project documentation. RESPECT the existing documentation architecture. 

**REVIEW** documentation updates at the end of every turn to avoid build-up of redundant/conflicting notes/information over the course of multiple edits.
