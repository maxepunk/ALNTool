# Archive Directory - Historical Documentation

**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Warning**: DO NOT USE THESE DOCUMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT

This directory contains 130+ historical documentation files that were archived during the documentation consolidation effort on January 7, 2025.

## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Conflicting Information**: Multiple documents claimed different states (e.g., "Phase 1 complete" vs "app broken")
2. **Outdated Metrics**: Claims like "88.26% test coverage" and "79+ error boundaries" were inaccurate
3. **Duplication**: ~37% of files were duplicates or near-duplicates
4. **Temporal Confusion**: Mix of progress tracking, aspirational goals, and actual state
