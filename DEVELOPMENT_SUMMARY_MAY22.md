# StoryForge Development Summary - May 22, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the development work completed on May 22, 2025, focusing on the Visual Zones implementation and Memory Attribute Parsing features.

## Completed Work

### 1. Visual Zones Implementation (Alternative to Dagre Compound Nodes)

#### Background
- **Problem**: Dagre's compound node feature was causing persistent `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'rank')` errors
- **Decision**: Implement an alternative visual grouping strategy using background zones with interactive headers

#### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `storyforge/frontend/src/components/RelationshipMapper/NarrativeZone.jsx`
  - Renders individual zones with color-coded backgrounds
  - Interactive headers with expand/collapse functionality
  - Displays zone title and member count
  
- `storyforge/frontend/src/components/RelationshipMapper/ZoneLayer.jsx`
  - Manages multiple zones with proper layering
  - Sorts zones by size for correct visual hierarchy

**Files Modified:**
- `storyforge/frontend/src/components/RelationshipMapper/useGraphTransform.js`
  - Added `detectNarrativeZones()` function to identify semantic groups
  - Added `calculateZoneBounds()` to determine zone boundaries
  - Returns zones Map along with nodes and edges

- `storyforge/frontend/src/components/RelationshipMapper/RelationshipMapper.jsx`
  - Added zone state management (expandedZones, highlightedZone)
  - Implemented zone interaction handlers
  - Integrated ZoneLayer component
  - Added zone controls to the control panel

#### Zone Types Implemented
1. **Puzzle Zones** (Orange, dashed border)
   - Groups puzzles with their required elements and rewards
   
2. **Container Zones** (Blue, solid border)
   - Groups containers with their contents
   
3. **Journey Zones** (Green, solid border)
   - For character views: starting items and collaboration points
   
4. **Narrative Zones** (Purple, solid border)
   - Groups elements sharing narrative threads (3+ members)

#### Features
- Automatic zone detection based on edge relationships
- Visual grouping with semi-transparent colored backgrounds
- Interactive headers for expanding/collapsing zones
- Hover highlighting for zone emphasis
- Zone controls in the mapper panel showing all detected zones

### 2. Memory Attribute Parsing

#### Implementation
**File Modified:**
- `storyforge/frontend/src/pages/ElementDetail.jsx`
  - Added `parseMemoryAttributes()` function
  - Enhanced memory data display section
  - Parses structured data from element descriptions

#### Supported Attributes
- `SF_RFID: [value]` - Primary RFID tag identifier
- `Memory Type: [value]` - Type of memory (Audio, Video, etc.)
- `Memory Owner: [value]` - Character who owns the memory
- `Memory Date: [value]` - When the memory occurred
- `Memory Location: [value]` - Where the memory took place

#### UI Enhancement
- Memory attributes displayed in a bordered box with secondary color
- RFID values shown in monospace font for clarity
- Graceful fallback message when no structured data is found

### 3. Technical Debt Cleanup

**Files Moved to _deprecated folder:**
- `ClusterHull.jsx` and `ClusterHull.test.jsx`
- `relationshipUtils.js`

These files were part of the previous compound node attempt and are no longer needed with the Visual Zones approach.

### 4. PRD Update

Updated `StoryForge PR.txt` to version 3.4.0 documenting:
- Visual Zones implementation as the alternative to Dagre compound nodes
- Memory attribute parsing completion
- Known technical issues and resolutions
- Updated action plan status

## Testing Recommendations

### Visual Zones Testing
1. **Alex Reeves Character View**
   - Verify journey zones for starting items
   - Check collaboration zones for cross-character dependencies
   
2. **UV Light Puzzle View**
   - Confirm puzzle zone encompasses inputs and outputs
   - Test zone collapse/expand functionality
   
3. **Derek's Gym Bag Container View**
   - Verify container zone includes all contents
   - Check zone header shows correct item count

### Memory Parsing Testing
1. Create test elements with various memory attribute formats
2. Verify parsing handles missing attributes gracefully
3. Test with malformed attribute syntax

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test zones with 50+ node graphs
   - Verify zone interactions don't conflict
   - Performance profiling

2. **Zone Refinements**
   - Fine-tune zone colors and opacity
   - Adjust zone padding for better visual clarity
   - Consider adding zone legends

3. **Advanced Mapper Features**
   - Information-rich tooltips
   - Node status chips
   - Enhanced edge labels

### Future Considerations
1. **Zone Persistence**
   - Save expanded/collapsed state per user
   - Remember zone preferences across sessions

2. **Advanced Zone Features**
   - User-defined custom zones
   - Zone-based filtering
   - Zone analytics (e.g., complexity metrics)

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Consider moving memory parsing to backend if needed
   - Add zone metadata to graph API responses

## Technical Notes

### Why Visual Zones Over Compound Nodes
1. **Library Limitations**: Dagre's compound node implementation has unresolved bugs
2. **Flexibility**: Zones can overlap and have more flexible visual representations
3. **Performance**: No complex parent-child hierarchy calculations
4. **Maintainability**: Simpler implementation with fewer edge cases

### Architecture Benefits
- Separation of concerns: Zone detection separate from layout
- Extensible: Easy to add new zone types
- Testable: Zone detection logic can be unit tested independently

## Conclusion

The Visual Zones implementation successfully addresses the core need for hierarchical grouping in the Relationship Mapper without the technical limitations of Dagre compound nodes. Combined with the memory attribute parsing, these features significantly enhance the usability of StoryForge for narrative designers and asset managers working on "About Last Night."
