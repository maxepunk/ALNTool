Re: NeurAI Cease and Desist
To the Board of Directors of NeurAI
The Patchwork Law firm has been retained by Alex Reeves in a suit against Marcus Blackwood and NeurAI regarding the theft of intellectual property in the formation and code base of NeurAI. On July 8, 2024, Mr. Blackwood incorporated NeurAI as a Deleware Corporation under IRS code 1120 with Mr. Blackwood as the sole owner and Executive Officer of the company. The mission of NeurAI is to develop memory capture technology through administration of Psychotrophin3B and application of artificial intelligence. However, this idea was developed in collaboration with Mr. Reeves, and in fact, was the sole intellectual property of Mr. Reeves. Mr. Reeves initiated the idea, spent the full months of May and June 2024 developing the code base and training the artificial intelligence of the memory capture and storage devices. ILLUMINATION of our assertions can be found in the code base documentation and coding architecture, which aligns with Mr. Reeves’s programming style and not with Mr. Blackwood’s nonexistent programming style.
In their prior company, a Y Incubator funded startup called BizAI, Mr. Reeves performed all the software, hardware, and business development for the company while Mr. Blackwood’s sole role as the CEO was partying with investors. When Mr. Blackwood brokered the deal to sell BizAI, Mr. Reeves was given only a small portion of the promised stock that was agreed upon at BizAI’s incorporation.
We insist that NeurAI pause operations, immediately ceasing and desisting from using any of Mr. Reeves’s IP. Furthermore, we insist that Mr. Blackwood is ousted as the Chief Executive Officer of NeurAI. Mr. Reeves will assume a role as Chief Technology Officer and the board of directors will select and instill a neutral party as the interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Reeves will also be given all the equity that Mr. Blackwood has. Any further use of Mr. Reeves’s code base and intellectual property will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
The NeurAI Board has until February 28, 2025 to comply with our demands or the Patchwork Law Firm will initiate legal proceedings on intellectual property theft. Mr. Reeves has a plethora of evidence ILLUMINATING our case and we’re confident in our ability to SHINE A LIGHT on the truth and to convince a judge to rule in our favor.
Sincerely,
The Patchwork Law Firm
