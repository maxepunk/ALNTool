Hey Marcus,
I hear that Victoria’s committed $20 Million for your next round of funding. What. The Actual. Fuck. Look, I get it, you’re a slick salesman and have history with Victoria, but seriously?? My company literally is going to be in the black soon with earned revenue and Victoria won’t give us the time of the day, but you with your mediocre idea and code can secure $20 million?? UGH, I hate silicon valley!
