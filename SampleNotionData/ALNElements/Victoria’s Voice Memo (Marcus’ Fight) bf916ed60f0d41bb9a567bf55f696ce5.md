I can’t… What?
Jesus—-Christ… Marcus.
I am so screwed. This guy is supposed to be my golden goose and mother—-
A fist fight! He gets into a fist fight with his former business partner in the middle of the dance floor!
God I’m so screwed. I’m so screwed. I am so screwed.
Alright. Victoria. Breathe.
Speak it out. Write it down. Burn it away and Move on.
That’s what we do.
That asshole is too much of a liability. Time to move on.
