hey..
Alex:
I just wanted to say I’m sorry—you shouldn’t have had to deal with that.
Sarah:
sure thanks—kinda made me think of the old times
Alex:
that’s not fair
Sarah:
Oh yeah? And somehow I recall breaking up a fist fight between you two the last time you were at one of his parties too.
Alex:
You know why that happened.
Sarah:
I do. It’s not your fault—not really. We both know it.
Alex:
Why the hell are you still with him? he’s such an asshole
Sarah:
I know.. he is..but he’s my asshole. Go home Alex—I’m sure we’ll do this again in another few years
Sarah:
It really was nice to see you again until you tried to break my husband’s nose.
Sarah:
Just— get home safe. ok?
Alex:
Ok…. good night
