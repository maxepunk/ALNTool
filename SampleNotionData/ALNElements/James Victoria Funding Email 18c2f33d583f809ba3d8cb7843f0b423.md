Subject: Funding for AIBioComp
Dear Victoria,
I hope your week is going well. Here at AIBioComp, we’ve successfully onboarded our new VP of growth and marketing. We’re already seeing great results of Sandy’s work, with twenty new clients onboarded, bringing our MRR to $350,000, and have high hopes of what he can do in the next couple of months. My  technical team and I have been hard at work optimizing the machine learning algorithm and we made a revolutionary breakthrough that will make our AI better than any other on the market. We’re almost ready to raise our next round of funding and I would love to arrange a meeting with you to discuss your involvement. I know you’ve promised $3 Million to Marcus at NeurAI, but I’m pretty sure his algorithm is at least a year outdated and ours is far superior. I recently had a Zoom meeting with him and was baffled at how little he understands his own code base and the technical ramifications of his memory storage devices.
Anyways, please let me know your availability for a short meeting at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely,
James
CEO AIBioComp
