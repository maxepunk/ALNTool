Description/Text: email to her firm laying out the divorce and that she's taking sarah on as a client sent late at night  during the party
"This email is to note that I've taken on Sarah Blackwood as a client in her divorce proceedings with Marcus Blackwood. I've known Marcus and Sarah for over a decade and actually met Marcus first at Stanford, but Sarah's case is better and I think it's best for our law firm if I retain Sarah as a client. This will be a high profile divorce since Marcus is pretty big in the AI tech startup world and their assets are considerable. I just spoke with Sarah about her case and am currently gathering information to support her claims of Marcus's years of infidelity (heck, I had an affair with him a long time ago). I know that his current mistress, Jessicah, is here, I think Sarah mentioned that Marcus was dumb enough to have gotten her pregnant? Will report back when I have some more conclusive evidence"

"I found her. Jessicah is pissed at Marcus since he broke up with her right after she got pregant. Jessicah just happened to have her pre-natal paternity test. See attached. Look at that probability!‚Äù
