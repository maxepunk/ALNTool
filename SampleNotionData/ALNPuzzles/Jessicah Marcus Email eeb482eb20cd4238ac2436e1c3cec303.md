Description/Text: When are you leaving her? I hate this sneaking around and hiding thing. I freaking love you. I’ve loved you for a while and I want you to put a ring on my finger and a baby in my tummy! Just tell Sarah you don’t care about her anymore and that you want to be with me. Who cares about the money, just leave her already! Please babe!!!
xoxo Jess
