Subject: Funding for AIBioComp
Dear Victoria,
I hope your week is going well. Here at AIBioComp, we’ve successfully onboarded our new VP of growth and marketing. We’re already seeing great results of Sandy’s work, with twenty new clients onboarded, bringing our MRR to $350,000, and have high hopes of what he can do in the next couple of months. My  technical team and I have been hard at work optimizing the machine learning algorithm and we made a revolutionary breakthrough that will make our AI better than any other on the market. We’re almost ready to raise our next round of funding and I would love to arrange a meeting with you to discuss your involvement. I know you’ve promised $3 Million to Marcus at NeurAI, but I’m pretty sure his algorithm is at least a year outdated and ours is far superior. I recently had a Zoom meeting with him and was baffled at how little he understands his own code base and the technical ramifications of his memory storage devices.
Anyways, please let me know your availability for a short meeting at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely,
James
CEO AIBioComp",,,https://www.notion.so/1b62f33d583f80caacfef90aea72d35d

Not exactly sure about Marcus’s deal with Victoria. He kinda iced me out after we sold BizAI, which is so ironic since I’m the one who got screwed over in that deal, despite having done all the work. Anyways, I’m actually chatting with Victoria soon, gonna meet up with her at Marcus’s next rave. I’ll let you know if I find anything.

It’s been a while since YC, hope you’re doing well. Look, I know that Marcus started NeurAI without you, but I’m wondering if you have any info about him or the company that might be useful to me. As you probably know, Victoria Kingsly funded both my company and Marcus’s, but somehow, even though my company is doing so much better than his, he’s secured a ton of funding from her for his next round and she won’t give me the time of the day.

Patchwork LAW FIRM
mailto:patchworklawfirm@gmail.com
January 28, 2025
Re: NeurAI Cease and Desist
To the Board of Directors of NeurAI
The Patchwork Law firm has been retained by Alex Reeves in a suit against Marcus Blackwood and NeurAI regarding the theft of intellectual property in the formation and code base of NeurAI. On July 8, 2024, Mr. Blackwood incorporated NeurAI as a Deleware Corporation under IRS code 1120 with Mr. Blackwood as the sole owner and Executive Officer of the company. The mission of NeurAI is to develop memory capture technology through administration of Psychotrophin3B and application of artificial intelligence. However, this idea was developed in collaboration with Mr. Reeves, and in fact, was the sole intellectual property of Mr. Reeves. Mr. Reeves initiated the idea, spent the full months of May and June 2024 developing the code base and training the artificial intelligence of the memory capture and storage devices. ILLUMINATION of our assertions can be found in the code base documentation and coding architecture, which aligns with Mr. Reeves’s programming style and not with Mr. Blackwood’s nonexistent programming style.
In their prior company, a Y Incubator funded startup called BizAI, Mr. Reeves performed all the software, hardware, and business development for the company while Mr. Blackwood’s sole role as the CEO was partying with investors. When Mr. Blackwood brokered the deal to sell BizAI, Mr. Reeves was given only a small portion of the promised stock that was agreed upon at BizAI’s incorporation.
We insist that NeurAI pause operations, immediately ceasing and desisting from using any of Mr. Reeves’s IP. Furthermore, we insist that Mr. Blackwood is ousted as the Chief Executive Officer of NeurAI. Mr. Reeves will assume a role as Chief Technology Officer and the board of directors will select and instill a neutral party as the interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Reeves will also be given all the equity that Mr. Blackwood has. Any further use of Mr. Reeves’s code base and intellectual property will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Hey Marcus,
I hear that Victoria’s committed $20 Million for your next round of funding. What. The Actual. Fuck. Look, I get it, you’re a slick salesman and have history with Victoria, but seriously?? My company literally is going to be in the black soon with earned revenue and Victoria won’t give us the time of the day, but you with your mediocre idea and code can secure $20 million?? UGH, I hate silicon valley!
