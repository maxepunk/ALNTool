Connections: 10
Emotion towards CEO & others: Irritated about Marcus’ unpredictability / do things his (usually ber messy) way but he’s good…sooooo. Knows about drugs that steal people’s memories and doesn't want to go to prison and doesn't think it's worth it. Might have also had some convos with alex that he can run the company more steadily
Overview & Key Relationships: boss from that internship (at facebook where marcus used his neuroscience background to study social media networks) turned into new vc firm, didn’t fund last company, this is her first VC deal with the new company and she was a seed investor, big gamble. Can’t afford to have investors in her firm like Skyler lose confidence. 
Primary Action: Gives up her hope and trust in Marcus and begins planning her moves to distance herself from the liability he poses.
