Emotion towards CEO & others: he's cheating on her (always cheated on her), she’s turned a blind eye to cheating in past but now power is uneven and she’s concerned that this time he might leave
Overview & Key Relationships: married for 15 years, met at an internship program, no kids, relationship more convenience, helped each other out careerwise and she ended up leaving the workplace and being support/homemaker after years of having an incredibly successful and influential career of her own, he took her for granted, assume she’ll always be around,, marcus buys a lot of jewelry to cover up for everything else. Dont have a prenup and now shes totally reliant on him financially because they kept separate bank accounts (marcus corporate shielded everything)
Primary Action: party away her resentment and frustration and plan her way out of the marriage.
