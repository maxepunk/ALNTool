Tier: Core
Type: Player
Connections: 5
Emotion towards CEO & others: Envy and Disgust. Finds Marcus to be sleazy and a crap programmer but likes the fun and new connections that come along with being in Marcus’ circles. 
Overview & Key Relationships: Marcus - former friend. sort of frenemy. other ceo, from y combinator cohort, biological computation/biofeedback ai company (maybe makes fungus robots?), has some technology that marcus needs (and marcus is stealing that memory), connected to victoria (both funded by victoria, contract funded intertwined and depends on how well either of their companies can perform almost like a reality game show, marcus crushing it but something feels fishy to James) Big fan of Howie. 
Primary Action: Snooping around at the party trying to figure out why he keeps getting shafted and Marcus gets more than 80% of the funding
