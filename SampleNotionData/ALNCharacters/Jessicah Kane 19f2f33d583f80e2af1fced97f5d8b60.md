Emotion towards CEO & others: Deeply heartbroken and pissed off at Marcus, but cannot help but hope that he’s going to come around and dump Sarah and raise their child with her. 
Overview & Key Relationships: Actor. Marcus’ (former?) mistress. She’s pregnant Marcus’ child and they’re in the middle of a break-up. He discovered she’s pregnant and he shut her out. They haven’t ‘officially’ broken up, but communication and closure are not Marcus’ thing, so she is actually  probably no longer Marcus’ mistress. She is family friend of Marcus and Sarah Blackwood, and has been a regular at Marcus & Derek’s parties. She met Sarah through work when Sarah was still working. Friends with Kai. Has a run-in with Sofia.
Primary Action: Spends most of the night trying to get 5 minutes alone with Marcus.  Has a moment with Sarah.
