Tier: Core
Type: Player
Connections: 10
Emotion towards CEO & others: Fuck that guy but I don’t wanna burn the bridge. Threatened litigation about IP rights but still showed up to Marcus’ party
Overview & Key Relationships: Marcus’ former business partner. worked on the y combinator company, got screwed over in the acquisition. The engineer that actually builds the stuff and makes science applicable. New company was actually his idea but Marcus just stole it and ran with it without him. Friends with Sarah rom the same internship program (bonded over the fact that Marcus is a douchebag).
Primary Action: Angling to take NeurAI from Marcus via Victoria’s influence.
